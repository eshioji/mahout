[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry is on his way out the door. Kramer is on the couch reading the paper]

JERRY: I'm doing a set tonight, you hanging out?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

JERRY: Alright.

[Jerry leaves. As soon as the door closes, Kramer jumps up a goes to the refridgerator. He opens it abruptly and the door slams against the sink]

[Kramer is smacking the bottom of a juice bottle trying to open it. He twists the cap off and proceeds to spill juice on the counter, the bar stool, and the floor. He reaches over and takes a couch cushion and mops up the liquid with it]

[Kramer is riding Jerry's bicycle around the apartment, doing laps around the couch]

[Kramer is hooking up a hose to the kitchen sink. We hear a fire alarm going off and see smoke coming from Jerry's bedroom. He runs to the bedroom with the hose in hand. The hose is pulled so tight it nearly lifts the sink out of the countertop]

[Kramer is struggling to move Jerry's couch across the hall into his apartment. The couch will not fit through the doorway. He tries to walk across the couch but smacks his head on the archway across the door]

[Kramer is sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table with Jerry's phone completely disabled in front of him. The phone starts to ring and he searches for the receiver. He picks up a few pieces then starts to speak into it]

KRAMER: Hello. Hello?

[Kramer puts the piece to his ear]

[Kramer is at the window taunting somebody on the street]

KRAMER: You better not! I'd like to see you come up here and say that to my face!!

[Next we see Kramer attempting to lock the front door while somebody on the other side is trying to kick it in]

[Kramer comes over a picks up a drink from the counter then sits down. We see that the apartment has been completely rearranged]

[Kramer comes out from behind a makeshift curtain wearing Jerry's suit and holding a soup ladle as a  microphone. He speaks to an imaginary crowd]

KRAMER: So what's the deal politics? I don't get it. Am I right people?

[He tries to imitate Jerry's smile]

[Kramer is sitting on the couch pouring some milk into a cup of tea for an older lady sitting next to him. The camera pulls back and we see the apartment jam packed with people having a party]

[Kramer is asleep on the couch. The apartment is back to its normal state. Jerry opens the door and comes in. He stares at Kramer on the couch]

JERRY: I don't believe this.

[Jerry walks over a picks a drinking glass off the coffee table a puts a coaster underneath it. He walks to his room shaking his head]


[George and Jerry enter a bookstore]

GEORGE: I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.

JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meeting anybody.

[Kramer walks up to Jerry and George while leafing through a book]

KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China.

JERRY: You better hurry.

GEORGE: I'm gonna hit the head.

KRAMER: Oh boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.

JERRY: Yes. The city needs more slow moving wicker vehicles.

[George is about to go into the bathroom. He grabs a book on his way in]

KRAMER: Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.

JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?

KRAMER: No, that wasn't dancing.

JERRY: Hey, there's Leo.

KRAMER: Oh? Who's Leo?

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Right. Uncle Leo. Forgot his first name.

[Kramer and Jerry both watch Leo looking at the books on a shelf. Then Leo takes a book and puts it under his coat]

JERRY: Did I just see that?!

KRAMER: Well, that ought to keep you busy for a few days, huh?


[At the annual Peterman party]

[Elaine is sitting alone at a table. Walter, a co-worker, comes up to her]

WALTER: So Elaine, are you going to dance this year?

ELAINE: Maybe... all over your face!

[A waiter serving food approaches Elaine]

SERVER: If you do dance, the cooks want to know so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.

[Elaine is looking both angry and embarrassed. Scene cuts to Peterman giving a toast]

PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wooly haired Melanesians of Papua, New Guinea once said...

[He makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up]

PETERMAN: Alright! Who's dancing?

[No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance]

PETERMAN: No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started.

[He grabs a female employee and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed]

[Scene cuts back to Elaine's table. A fellow employee sits down at Elaine's table]

ZACH: Hi, I'm Zach.

ELAINE: Hi, I'm miserable.

[They both laugh]


[At the bookstore]

[George casually puts the large book he took into the bathroom with him on the shelf. A manager notices and approaches him]

MANAGER: Excuse me, sir. What are you doing?

GEORGE: I'm all set.

MANAGER: Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?

GEORGE: What do you want to hear?


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: They made me buy it. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.

JERRY: Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.

GEORGE: They're selling coffee, bran muffins, you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!

JERRY: French Impressionist Paintings?

GEORGE: I find the soothing pastoral images very conducive...

JERRY: Thank you very much.

GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working. You want to catch a movie?

JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.

GEORGE: Alright, Leo! Sticking it to the man!

[Elaine enters and sits down]

JERRY: Sleeping in the car again?

ELAINE: Cocktail flu.

JERRY: Oh right, the big party.

GEORGE: You uh, didn't dance again, did you?

ELAINE: No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy and we had a few too many.

GEORGE: You went home with him?

ELAINE: Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!

JERRY: Ah, the drunken make out. An office classic. Did you end up Xeroxing anything?

ELAINE: Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?

JERRY: What's your position?

ELAINE: I am an associate.

GEORGE: Hey, me too.

[A waitress passes their table]

WAITRESS: Yeah, me too.

ELAINE: Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.

GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.

ELAINE: Oh, right. Because if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.

JERRY: As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko Roman wrestling.

ELAINE: Oh, bravo.


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry enters his apartment to find Newman and Kramer having a conference at his table]

JERRY: Oh hey, can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?

KRAMER: No, we've already eaten.

NEWMAN: But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.

KRAMER: Jerry, check this out. Remember my idea about rickshaws in New York? Well, we're gonna make it happen!

JERRY: No, you're not.

KRAMER: Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.

JERRY: No, he doesn't.

NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!

JERRY: Yes, it can.

KRAMER: We'll start out with one and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!

NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.

JERRY: So, who's gonna pull this thing?

[Kramer and Newman both look at each other]

KRAMER: Well, I just assumed you would.

NEWMAN: Yeah, but I thought...

[Kramer makes some stuttering noises to stop Newman from talking]

JERRY: My, isn't this an awkward moment?

KRAMER: What about the homeless?

NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later?

KRAMER: To pull the rickshaw.

NEWMAN: They do have an intimate knowledge of the street.

KRAMER: They're always walking around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!

JERRY: Now that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Uncle Leo enters and joins Jerry at his booth]

UNCLELEO: Jerry, hello!

[He sits down]

JERRY: So Leo, how's everything? You doing okay?

UNCLELEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?

UNCLELEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! But I'm not.

JERRY: Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.

UNCLELEO: Why didn't you say hello?

JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.

UNCLELEO: You still say hello.

JERRY: Leo, I saw you steal.

UNCLELEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it.

JERRY: Who, criminals?

UNCLELEO: Senior citizens. No big deal.

JERRY: You could get arrested.

UNCLELEO: Arrested? Come on! I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?

JERRY: Leo...

UNCLELEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two Shoes. You made your point.

JERRY: Thank you.

UNCLELEO: Will somebody answer that damn phone?!


[In Peterman's office building hallway]

ELAINE: Of course Zach and I have been dating. What did you think, I was the office skank?

WALTER: Well...

ELAINE: "Well?" We've been dating for three months. Between you and me and anyone else you want to tell.

[Elaine enters into the break room. There she sees Zach making out with another co-worker]

ELAINE: Oh man. Ugh.

WALTER: Isn't that Zach?

ELAINE: Yeah.

WALTER: Aren't you upset?

[She starts to fake cry]

ELAINE: Yes. Oh, man! Oh!


[On a NYC street]

[Kramer and Newman are standing there with a rickshaw. Close by are three homeless guys in a line]

KRAMER: Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws.

[One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away]

KRAMER: Now, I don't care where you're from or how you got here or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.

[One of the two remaining homeless men drops a bottle]

HOBOJOE: The government!

KRAMER: Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well toned upper body.

[Kramer looks at the two confused guys]

KRAMER: Or a shirt.

NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?

[The homeless man with a shirt raises his hand. Kramer pats him on the shoulder dust flies into the air]

KRAMER: Hey.

NEWMAN: Name, please.

RUSTY: Rusty.

NEWMAN: Rusty.

KRAMER: You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.

NEWMAN: Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Okay? Ready and go!

[Rusty takes off down the street with the rickshaw]

KRAMER: Giddy up! Good form.

NEWMAN: Alright, pace yourself, because you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.

[They both notice that Rusty is not stopping]

KRAMER: Hey, what's he doing?

NEWMAN: I think he’s stealing our rickshaw!

KRAMER: Well, then he's out!

[Newman stops his timer. The other homeless man is still standing in line alone]

[The remaining homeless guy salutes Kramer]

HOBOJOE: I'll take the job. Potato salad!


[At a bookstore]

[Jerry and George are at Brentano's. George is trying to return the book]

GEORGE: Yes, I uh, I need to return this book.

[The cashier puts the book's code into the computer]

CASHIER: I'm sorry, we can't take this book back.

GEORGE: Why not?

CASHIER: It's been flagged.

GEORGE: Flagged?

CASHIER: It's been in the bathroom.

GEORGE: It says that on the computer?

CASHIER: Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.

GEORGE: Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!

[George storms out. Jerry is about to follow until he sees Leo stealing another book]

JERRY: I don't believe this!

[He walks over to a security guard]

JERRY: Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting.

SECURITYGUARD: Mmm hmm. Where's your uncle?

JERRY: He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him. You know, set him straight.

[The security guard talks into his walkie talkie]

SECURITYGUARD: We have a fifty-one fifty in paperbacks. All units respond.

JERRY: Fifty-one fifty? That, that's just a scare, right?

SECURITYGUARD: Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this.

[The guard rushes toward Uncle Leo]

SECURITYGUARD: Swarm! Swarm!

[Suddenly, Leo is surrounded by guards]

UNCLELEO: What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!

SECURITYGUARD: You're under arrest.

JERRY: I just wanted you to scare him.

UNCLELEO: Jerry, you ratted me out?!

[Unsure of what to say, he remembers Leo's courtesy tip]

JERRY: Hello?

UNCLELEO: Hello.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry is on the phone with his parents]

JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.

HELEN: Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.

JERRY: Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.

MORTY: She's got priors.

JERRY: Prior convictions? Leo?

HELEN: It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.

MORTY: Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.

JERRY: What does that mean?

HELEN: Nobody pays for everything.

JERRY: You're stealing too?!

MORTY: Nothing. Batteries. Well, they wear out so quick.

JERRY: Mom, you too?

HELEN: Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.

[Kramer and Newman both enter]

JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.

KRAMER: Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he...

[He makes a noise]

KRAMER: ...he bolted.

JERRY: Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.

KRAMER: See, we should've gotten some collateral from him. Like his bag of cans or his other bag of cans.

NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.

[Newman and Kramer both go to leave]

JERRY: To the Idiotmobile!


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?

ELAINE: That is correct. But here's the beauty part, now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass and I'm the office...

JERRY: Tina Turner?

ELAINE: Alright.

[George enters with his large art book]

GEORGE: Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!

JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?

GEORGE: I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.

JERRY: Not underpants.

ELAINE: Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.

[Uncle Leo is at the front desk in Monk's. He's paying for his check]

JERRY: Uncle Leo. Hello!

UNCLELEO: Jerry.

JERRY: Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your... past.

UNCLELEO: You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!

JERRY: Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!

[Elaine has picked up George's book and is now thumbing through it]

ELAINE: French impressionism. Oh, I love this. Now, what is the problem with this book?

GEORGE: Nothing.

ELAINE: How much do you want for it?

GEORGE: You know, I could let it go for say... a hundred and twenty-five.

[Jerry has given up on Leo and now rejoins Elaine and George at the booth]

JERRY: Leo's furious.

[He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book]

JERRY: What is that doing on the table?

GEORGE: Jerry, simmer down.

JERRY: I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.

ELAINE: What is wrong with this book?

GEORGE: Simmer!

JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and...

ELAINE: Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!!

[She runs to the bathroom to wash her hands]

GEORGE: May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?

JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom.

GEORGE: Well, aren't you something?


[At Elaine's office]

[Peterman walks in]

PETERMAN: Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.

ELAINE: Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.

PETERMAN: Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love Newton?

ELAINE: Love Newton?

PETERMAN: I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.

ELAINE: An addict? Well, it just keeps getting better!

PETERMAN: And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand in search of low cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudo erotic tales of my own opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.

ELAINE: Look uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!

PETERMAN: Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. And you will be at his side.

ELAINE: Oh. Well, you know I had planned to uh...

PETERMAN: No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your associate status. Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.


[In Jerry's bedroom]

[Jerry is tossing and turning in his bed. Voices are going through his head while he's trying to sleep]

HELEN: It was a crime of passion.

UNCLELEO: If anyone betrays me, I never forget.

HELEN: He won't last a day in prison.

[Now, Jerry has slipped into a dream. He visualizes Leo in prison. The following scene of Leo in jail is a parody of the movie "Cape Fear"]

[Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers of his right hand and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull ups]

UNCLELEO: Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry.

[He rurns to the right, yelling out]

UNCLELEO: Answer that damn phone!

[Scene cuts to Jerry, who is just now waking up to the phone ringing. He answers it]

JERRY: Hello?

ELAINE: Hey, it's me.

JERRY: Uncle Leo?

ELAINE: Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?

JERRY: Nightmares. You?

ELAINE: My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.

ZACH: I'm burning up! Elaine!

ELAINE: Eat your soup!

JERRY: You're not feeding him are you?

ELAINE: Why?

[Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him]

ELAINE: I told you, away from the curtains. Away. Use your bucket.

[He vomits again, this time into the bucket]

ELAINE: There you go, that's it. You know what? I gotta go.

[Jerry hangs up then tries to go back to sleep. Kramer walks in]

KRAMER: Hey buddy.

JERRY: Ah! Kramer!

KRAMER: I thought I heard you.

JERRY: Get out of here!

NEWMAN: Kramer? Kramer?

[He enters Jerry's bedroom]

NEWMAN: There you are.

JERRY: Will everybody please leave?!

NEWMAN: I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.

KRAMER: Our rickshaw?

NEWMAN: It's entirely possible.

JERRY: I want everyone out!

KRAMER: Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.

NEWMAN: Good night.

JERRY: Good night, Newman.


[In the Park]

[Newman and Kramer both find the rickshaw and Rusty in the park]

NEWMAN: There it is!

KRAMER: Rusty!

RUSTY: Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. Let's get this baby home.

NEWMAN: Uh.

KRAMER: What?

NEWMAN: You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all the way back uptown. I mean after all, it is a conveyance.

KRAMER: Yes, that's true.

NEWMAN: So, which one of us is gonna pull?

KRAMER: Well, there's only one way to settle this.

[He starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme]

KRAMER: One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scarum, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe.

NEWMAN: Yeah.

KRAMER: Best two out of three?

[He starts the pointing and the rhyme again]

KRAMER: One spot, two spot...


[Scene cuts to Newman riding in the rickshaw. Kramer is pulling]

NEWMAN: Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling!


[At a homeless charity center]

[George is trying to give the book to the homeless. He comes across Rebecca DeMornay, the same woman who confronted Elaine about her muffin stumps in episode "The Muffin Tops"]

REBECCA: So, you want to donate this to charity?

GEORGE: Well, I assume there's some sort of write off.

REBECCA: What's the value of the book?

GEORGE: Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.

REBECCA: It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.

GEORGE: Oh.

[She opens the cover of the book]

REBECCA: Oh, wait a second. This book has been in the bathroom.

GEORGE: What are you talking about? That, that's ridiculous.

REBECCA: It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless here it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap them to a rickshaw!

GEORGE: Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do, do we have a deal?

REBECCA: Yeah, and here it is. You get your toilet book out of here and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!

GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise.

REBECCA: Here I come.

[George grabs his book and runs for his life]


[At a bookstore]

[Elaine and Jerry are both at the bookstore. Elaine is talking with the cashier while checking out a book]

ELAINE: So, this book will tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?

CASHIER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Great.

JERRY: So, the worst is over?

ELAINE: Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean and I'm the office hero.

JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.

ELAINE: Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. The Detox Poncho.

[She's through buying the book and is ready to go]

ELAINE: See you.

JERRY: I'd like to speak with the manager, please.


[On a NYC street]

[Newman is being pulled up a steep hill on the rickshaw by Kramer]

NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop chop!

KRAMER: Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break.

[He sets the rickshaw down taking a rest]

NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.

KRAMER: Oh.

[The rickshaw starts to roll back down the hill]

NEWMAN: Boy. Boy. Kramer!

[The rickshaw starts to rapidly go down the street. Kramer makes an attempt to chase it]

KRAMER: Whoa! Wait!

NEWMAN: Ah! Yah!!

[Zach is walking out into the street]

ZACH: Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life!

[Newman is still rolling down the hill]

NEWMAN: Wah!!

[Zach and the rickshaw collide. From back up on top of the street, Kramer tries to separate himself from the accident. He starts walking, then running away from the crushed rickshaw]


[At a bookstore]

[Jerry is in Brentano's waiting for the manager. He sees George enter]

JERRY: George? What are you doing here?

GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked.

JERRY: It certainly has.

GEORGE: So, I'm gonna steal another one and then return it. That way everything is even.

JERRY: You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back, and to you that's even?

GEORGE: I'm going in!

[George walks off to steal one of the books. The manager walks up to Jerry]

MANAGER: Did you want to speak with the manager?

JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was caught shoplifting here the other day.

MANAGER: Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.

JERRY: Oh come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.

MANAGER: That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.

JERRY: So it could be anyone?

MANAGER: I guess. As long as we catch him in the act.

[Jerry turns to George. George has a huge bundle under his overcoat and is trying to act innocent]

JERRY: That guy!

[He points at George]

JERRY: Swarm! Swarm!

[George is instantly surrounded by guards]

GEORGE: No! Jerry!
