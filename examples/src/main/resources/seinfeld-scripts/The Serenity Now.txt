[The Costanzas are driving in their car]

FRANK: I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.

ESTELLE: That's as far as it goes.

FRANK: There's a mechanism. You just pull it and throw your body weight.

ESTELLE: I pulled it. It doesn't go.

FRANK: If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!

GEORGE: Alright Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.

FRANK: Like an animal. Because of her I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!

GEORGE: What is that?

FRANK: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, "Serenity now!"

GEORGE: Are you supposed to yell it?

FRANK: The man on the tape wasn't specific.

GEORGE: What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?

ESTELLE: I told you to fix that thing.

FRANK: Serenity now!
 

[At Monk's Cafe]

PATTY: So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish place La Caridad on Saturday.

JERRY: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.

PATTY: Well, I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.

JERRY: What? Alright, fine.

PATTY: Are you mad at me?

JERRY: No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.

PATTY: You know I've never seen you mad.

JERRY: I get peeved.

PATTY: Mad.

JERRY: Miffed.

PATTY: Mad.

JERRY: Irked?

PATTY: I'd like to see you get really mad.


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Why does she want you to be mad?

JERRY: She says I suppress my emotions.

GEORGE: So what do you care what she thinks.

JERRY: Good body.

GEORGE: She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.

JERRY: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.

GEORGE: Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Kramer, I am so sick of you coming in here and eating all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!

[Kramer laughs

KRAMER: What is that, a new bit?

GEORGE: I told you. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?

JERRY: Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.

KRAMER: I'll do it.

GEORGE: Really? You wanna come?

KRAMER: Yeah, I love going to the country.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Where are they going?

JERRY: Fix a screen door in Queens.

ELAINE: That's funny. Hey listen, what are you doing Saturday night?

JERRY: Not going to the Knick game.

ELAINE: I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.

JERRY: You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.

[She takes the game Boggle out of a bag]

ELAINE: Oh, I don't think that's possible.


[At the Costanza's house]

[Kramer's taking a picture]

KRAMER: Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. Perfect.

GEORGE: Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.

ESTELLE: I hate that old door. Throw it out!

FRANK: Serenity now!

KRAMER: It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for you.

FRANK: Will you put her to rest for me?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.

[He rips the screen door off its hinges]  

ESTELLE: Get George to put those boxes in the garage!

GEORGE: Dad, what's all this?

ESTELLE: It's junk.

FRANK: My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!

GEORGE: You're selling computers?

FRANK: Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading and I realized it wasn't that farfetched.

GEORGE: Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?

FRANK: Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon. My son.


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!

PATTY: I think they have one percent over there.

JERRY: One percent?! They can kiss one percent of my ass!

PATTY: Okay, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it.

JERRY: You're damn right you're not buying it!

PATTY: You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.

JERRY: I'm open. There's just nothing in there.

PATTY: Uh huh.

JERRY: Oh, you think I'm lying about this?

PATTY: I think you are.

JERRY: Well, I'm not.

PATTY: Yes you are, liar.

JERRY: Oh, stop it.

PATTY: Okay, liar.

JERRY: That's enough!

PATTY: Oh, that was good.

JERRY: Really? It felt good.


[At the Lippman Bar Mitzvah]

ELAINE: Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.

MRLIPPMAN: Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.

ELAINE: Oh, congratulations Adam.

[Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine]

ADAM: I'm a man!


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Tongue?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was twenty-three.

JERRY: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.

ELAINE: And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs.

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No no no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Good bye. 
[He hangs up]

JERRY: Hey, I'm flying first class.

ELAINE: Where did that come from?

JERRY: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Good.

GEORGE: Alright, relax tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.

JERRY: What? The two of you working in that garage is like a steel cage death match.


[In the apartment hallway. Kramer is installing a screen door to his apartment]

GEORGE: Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: What, what are you doing?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.

JERRY: What do you need it for?

KRAMER: The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes.

[He opens the screen door and lets it swing close]

KRAMER: Oh yeah yeah yeah.


[At the Costanza's house]

GEORGE: Morning, ma.

ESTELLE: You're late!

GEORGE: Morning, dad.

FRANK: I'm not dad in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza and I will refer to you as Costanza.

[Lloyd Braun enters]

FRANK: Morning, Braun.

[Lloyd hands Frank some coffee]

LLOYD: Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.

GEORGE: What is Lloyd Braun doing here?

FRANK: Your mother recommended him.

GEORGE: Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is, "Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?" Did you know he was in a mental institution?

FRANK: I didn't read his resume.

[Lloyd rings a bell]

LLOYD: Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.

GEORGE: What is this?

[Frank draws a zero under George's name on a blackboard]

FRANK: This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.

ESTELLE: Good for you, Lloyd!


[At Mr. Lippman's house]

ELAINE: So Adam, I just talked to your father and apology accepted.

ADAM: I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.

ELAINE: Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.

ADAM: Are you free Friday night?

ELAINE: I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen and I am in my early... twenties.

ADAM: But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.

ELAINE: No. You are not a man. It takes a long time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.

ADAM: Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts and then somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!

[Mr. Lippman enters]

MRLIPPMAN: Who wants cookies?

ADAM: As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!

[He leaves]

MRLIPPMAN: What?

ELAINE: Walnuts, mmm.  


[At the Costanza's house]

FRANK: You're late again Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.

ESTELLE: You're not giving away our Waterpik!

FRANK: Serenity now!

GEORGE: You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!

FRANK: I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun!

[Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles]

GEORGE: You wanna sell computers? I will show you how to sell computers!

[He gets on the phone and dials]

GEORGE: Hello, Mr. Farneman? You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? Alright, I see! Good answer! Thank you!

[Lloyd rings his sales bell]

GEORGE: Serenity now!


[At Mr. Lippman's house]

ELAINE: Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.

ADAM: Well, that does me a lot of good. Early twenties!

ELAINE: Well, I'm sorry sir, I tried.

MRLIPPMAN: So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?

ELAINE: Uh. I guess so. Why?

[Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her]


[In Jerry's apartment hallway]

PATTY: What is this?

JERRY: Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.

[Kramer sprays his flowers]

KRAMER: Hello, neighbor.

JERRY: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.

KRAMER: Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.

JERRY: You barbecuing tonight?

[Kramer rings his wind chimes]

KRAMER: Right after the fireworks.


[In Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: So, where do you want to eat tonight?

PATTY: How about La Caridad again?

JERRY: Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?

PATTY: Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.

JERRY: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!

PATTY: Maybe I should just leave.

JERRY: Maybe!?

PATTY: Good bye!

JERRY: Double good bye!

[As Patty leaves, the open door reveals Kramer sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler]

KRAMER: Hey, buddy!

[Elaine walks up]

ELAINE: Hey. Happy New Year!

KRAMER: You all come back real...

[Jerry shuts the door]

ELAINE: Did you and Patty just break up?

JERRY: Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!

[He goes to the bathroom and shuts the door]

ELAINE: Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.

[Jerry comes out of the bathroom]

JERRY: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also but I wasn't in the mood.

ELAINE: Whoa. What is the matter?

JERRY: It's Patty.

ELAINE: Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.

[Jerry rubs his eyes]

JERRY: What, what is this salty discharge?

ELAINE: Oh my God. You're crying.

JERRY: This is horrible! I care!


[Later, in Jerry's hallway]

JERRY: Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.

KRAMER: She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?

JERRY: I don't know what's happening to me.

KRAMER: Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Pandora's box.

JERRY: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.

KRAMER: Yeah, well she had one too.

[George walks up]

GEORGE: Jerry, can I talk to you for a second?

[They enter Jerry's apartment. A baseball flies in and hits Kramer]

KRAMER: That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keeping it.

[A rock flies in and almost hits him]

KRAMER: And you're not getting back your rock either!

[He tries to enter his apartment but runs face first into the screen door]

[In Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.

JERRY: You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?

GEORGE: Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn and stock quotes.

JERRY: Porn quotes. I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I love you, George. Come here.

GEORGE: I, I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I, I gotta go.

JERRY: Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that hose I put under your sink?

JERRY: Hose under my sink. I love you, Kramer!

KRAMER: I love you too, buddy, and George.

GEORGE: I don't want to hear it, Kramer!

[Kramer close Jerry's door and peers through the peephole]

KRAMER: Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.

GEORGE: What signal? What, what signal?

KRAMER: I'll yell uh, hoochie mama!

GEORGE: If I do it, will you buy a computer?

KRAMER: On the signal, George. On the signal.

GEORGE: Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.

JERRY: I love you, Costanza.

GEORGE: Will you shut up?!

KRAMER: Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet!

[Kramer opens the door and steps into the hallway. He tries to spray the hose but nothing is coming out. Meanwhile, he is being doused by multiple streams of foam from the kids]

KRAMER: George, turn on the faucet!

[He falls to the floor after becoming almost completely covered in foam]

KRAMER: Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!

 
[Elaine and George are in a cab]

ELAINE: So now the other Lippman kissed me.

GEORGE: Well, sure. They're Jewish and you're a shiksa.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: It means a non-Jewish woman.

ELAINE: I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?

GEORGE: You've got shiksappeal. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.

ELAINE: Oh, that's insane.

GEORGE: I'll tell you what's insane, the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.

ELAINE: I am not buying a computer from you.

GEORGE: There's porn.

ELAINE: Even so.

GEORGE: Damn it!

 
[At Mr. Lippman's house]

ELAINE: Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I, I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.

MRLIPPMAN: That's simply not true.

ELAINE: If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.

MRLIPPMAN: You are wrong. I'll prove it.

ELAINE: Oh no. Don't!

MRLIPPMAN: I renounce Judaism!

ELAINE: Oy vey!

 
[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: What happened to you, pal?

KRAMER: Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of Grade A's.

JERRY: Are you alright?

KRAMER: Oh no, I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.

JERRY: So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?

[Kramer tries to open a bag of chips]

KRAMER: Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey, what happened to you?

KRAMER: Serenity!

[He leaves]

ELAINE: Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is totally out of control. What is with you people? What are you looking at?

JERRY: Sit down, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh no, Jerry. I can't take any more gentle sobbing.

JERRY: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.

ELAINE: Do you have an apple or anything?

JERRY: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.

ELAINE: Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.

JERRY: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning.

ELAINE: Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ah, banana!

JERRY: When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Elaine.

[He gets down on one knee]

[George enters Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers]

GEORGE: Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store them in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring them all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?

JERRY: I'm asking Elaine to marry me.

GEORGE: I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.

JERRY: Elaine?

ELAINE: Uh, Jerry, I've got a lot going on with uh, Lippman right now.

JERRY: Lippman?

ELAINE: Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!

JERRY: Can I help you?

ELAINE: No. Stay! Stay. Stay.

 
[In the Costanza's garage]

FRANK: Hey Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!

GEORGE: Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?

FRANK: Costanza, you're white hot!

[A recording on the phone can be heard, "If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and..."]

FRANK: Hey Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same, you're fired. Costanza, you've won the Waterpik!

ESTELLE: You're not gonna give away that Waterpik!

FRANK: You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!

LLOYD: You know, you should tell your dad that serenity now thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger and eventually you blow.

GEORGE: What do you know? You were in the nut house.

LLOYD: What do you think put me there?

GEORGE: I heard they found a family in your freezer

LLOYD: Serenity now. Insanity later.

 
[In Jerry's hallway]

JERRY: What happened here, Kramer?

KRAMER: Serenity now, serenity now...

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done some redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.

JERRY: You don't look well.

KRAMER: Well, that's odd, because I feel perfectly at peace with the world. Uh! Eggs! You! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.

KRAMER: Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment?

[Kramer goes into his apartment and yells]

KRAMER: Serenity now!

[George enters]

GEORGE: Jerry! I did it! Ha ha! I beat Braun!

[Crashing and banging can be heard]

KRAMER: Serenity now!

GEORGE: Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?

KRAMER: Serenity now!


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy twenty-five computers?!

KRAMER: George, you listen to me. I owe you one.

JERRY: He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?

GEORGE: Oh, please don't tell me you love me again Jerry, I can't handle it.

JERRY: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly obvious observations. How about you?

GEORGE: Alright... here goes...
 

[At the Rabbi's office]

ELAINE: Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiksa appeal?

RABBI: Ha! Elaine, shiksa appeal is a myth, like the Yeti or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.

ELAINE: Well, something's going on here because every able bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.

RABBI: Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?

ELAINE: Well, what does that have to do...

RABBI: You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays?

[Elaine has left]

RABBI: Elaine? Lainey?

 
[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: So, that's it. All of my darkest fears and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.

JERRY: Yikes. Well, good look with all that.

GEORGE: Where you going? I, I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.

JERRY: I think you scared me straight.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Alright Jerome, I'm in.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.

JERRY: I tell you, I don't see it happening.

ELAINE: What? What happened to the new Jerry?

JERRY: He doesn't work here anymore.

ELAINE: Oh, well that's just great!

GEORGE: I love you, Jerry.

JERRY: Right back at you, slick.

GEORGE: You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.

ELAINE: Well, that's because you're an idiot.

 
[In the Costanza's garage]

FRANK: You single handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.

GEORGE: Well, what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?

FRANK: He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.

ESTELLE: I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!

FRANK: This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!

ESTELLE: Alright.

GEORGE: Dad, you really should lay off the serenity now stuff.

FRANK: So, what am I supposed to say?

GEORGE: Hoochie mama?

ESTELLE: Move your crap, I'm coming in!

[Estelle tries to drive her car into the garage]

FRANK: No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
