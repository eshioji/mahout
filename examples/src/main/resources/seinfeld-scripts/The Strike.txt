[At Tim Whatley's apartment]

ELAINE: So, Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.

[Elaine laughs. Whatley enters]

TIMWHATLEY: Hey! Happy Chanukah!

JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.

[Tim holds up a mistletoe suggesting a kiss from Elaine] 

TIMWHATLEY: Eh?

[Elaine shrugs it off]

ELAINE: eh.

TIMWHATLEY: Oh.

[He turns to George]

TIMWHATLEY: Hey George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew.

[He notices a woman walking by]

TIMWHATLEY: Oh hey, listen, I'd better circulate.

[He moves over to the woman]

TIMWHATLEY: Happy Chanukah, Tiffany!

ELAINE: This place is like Studio Fifty-four with a menorah.

GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.

[He leaves]

ELAINE: Oh.

[She sees a guy looking at her]

ELAINE: I got denim vest checking me out. Fake phone number's coming out tonight.

JERRY: You have a standard fake?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

[He notices an attractive woman walking by and starts to follow her] 

JERRY: That's neat.

[Elaine holds onto Jerry's arm]

ELAINE: No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!

[Jerry escapes Elaine's grasp and moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine]

DENIMVEST: Hi!

[Jerry talks to the woman]

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.

GWEN: Hi.

JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.

[Back to Elaine]

ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the big metal buttons

DENIMVEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should uh, go out some time?

ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?

GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.

JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing, "We don't care, and it shows."

JERRY: You're gonna open your mail here?

GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.

[He starts flipping through envelopes, reads one]

GEORGE: "Have you seen me?"

[He flicks it aside]

GEORGE: Nope.

[He looks at the next envelope]

GEORGE: Whoa, something from Whatley.

JERRY: See? You give and you get.

GEORGE: "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance?"

JERRY: Oh, that's nice.

GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"

JERRY: To a children's charity!

GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hey.

[A waitress moves toward the table]

ELAINE: Oh, nothing for me.

[The waitress leaves]

ELAINE: I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.

JERRY: "Atomic Sub?" Why are you eating there?

ELAINE: I got a card and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. Twenty-four stamps and I become a submarine...

[She makes a salute gesture]

ELAINE: ...captain.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: Free sub.

[George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card]

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

ELAINE: What is it?

[She grabs the card from George. He tries to stop her but fails. She reads it out loud]

ELAINE: "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?

GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it.

JERRY: When George was growing up...

GEORGE: Jerry, No!

JERRY: His father...

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.

ELAINE: Oh. And another piece of the puzzle falls into place.

GEORGE: Alright.

JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?

[Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably and continues to do so]

GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!

JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?

[Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter]

GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! Are you happy now?!

[He gathers his things and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Elaine is digging into her purse]

ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card! Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: I've eaten twenty-three bad subs. I just need one more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!

JERRY: No, you walk out.

ELAINE: Alright then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.

JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!

ELAINE: I want that free sub.

JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! They're cloning sheep now.

KRAMER: No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!

JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow off number and see if he's called it?

ELAINE: That's a good idea.

[Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through his coat and pulls it out of the pocket]

KRAMER: Yeah, Go! What? Really? Yeah, okay. Yeah! Bye.

[He hangs up]

KRAMER: Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.

JERRY: What strike?

KRAMER: Yeah, H and H Bagels. That's where I worked.

JERRY: You?

ELAINE: Worked?

JERRY: Bagels?

KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.

[He pulls it out and hands it to Elaine]

KRAMER: Yeah, we've been on strike for twelve years.

ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there but I haven't seen them in a long time.

KRAMER: Yeah, well H and H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.

ELAINE: What were your demands?

KRAMER: Yeah, five thirty-five an hour. And that's what they're paying now.

ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.

KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that! Alright, I've got to go.

[He heads for the door]

JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?

KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!

[He leaves]


[At the H and H Bagel Shop]

[Kramer walks through the door]

KRAMER: Alright, everybody! I'm back!

BAGELMANAGER: Who are you?

KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer. Strikes over.

BAGELMANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.

KRAMER: Huh. What, didn't any of the guys come back?

BAGELMANAGER: No, I’m sure they all got jobs like, ten years ago.

KRAMER: Oh man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.

BAGELMANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays.

KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!

[He takes off his coat and puts it in the display case then turns to see a plate full of bagels]

KRAMER: What are those?

BAGELMANAGER: Those are raisin bagels.

[Kramer picks one up, he's mesmerized] 

KRAMER: I never thought I'd live to see that.


[At the Horse Track Betting]

[Elaine confronts two unattractive bookies]

ELAINE: So anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.

BOOKIE: So, you're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls for you for five years.

ELAINE: So listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number...

BOOKIE: Hey Charlie! Guess who's here? Elaine Benes.

[A co-worker in the back speaks up]

CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!

[Various other men in the line behind Elaine say the same thing]

BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.

CHARLIE: I'm a man.

ELAINE: Oh. My.

BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just uh, give it to me and that way I'll have it.

[He slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down]

ELAINE: My number? Oh...

[She looks at Kramer's business card]

ELAINE: Okay. Uh, well, there you go.

[She writes H and H's number down]

ELAINE: And uh, tell you what.

[She looks at the board in the back]

ELAINE: Put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.


[At a classy restaurant]

[Jerry and Tim Whatley meet]

TIMWHATLEY: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey, Tim.

TIMWHATLEY: What's up?

JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.

TIMWHATLEY: Mazel Tov.

[Jerry's date, Gwen, arrives. She's completely unattractive]

GWEN: Jerry, hi.

JERRY: Gwen?

GWEN: Yeah.

JERRY: Really?

GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.

[Tim gives Jerry a face, almost like he feels sorry for Jerry]


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: So, attractive one day, not attractive the next?

JERRY: Have you come across this?

GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome. She's a two-face.

JERRY: Like the Batman villain?

GEORGE: If that helps you.

JERRY: So, if I ask her out again I don't know who's showing up. The good, the bad, or the ugly.

GEORGE: Clint Eastwood!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley.

[He gives a Christmas card to Jerry]

JERRY: "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." What is that?

GEORGE: Made it up.

JERRY: "The Human Fund. Money for people."

GEORGE: What do you think?

JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.

GEORGE: The Outlaw of Josey Whales!

JERRY: Yeah.

[Kramer enters]

[He is holding a sack full of bagels]

KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen. Bagels on the house!

JERRY: How was your first day?

KRAMER: Oh, fantastic!

[Jerry and George both pick out a bagel]

KRAMER: It felt so good to get my hands back in that dough.

[Jerry and George stop before they take a bite from their bagels]

JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?

KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels.

[Jerry and George both take a bite]

KRAMER: Yeah, they're day olds. The homeless won't even touch them.

[Jerry and George stop eating]

KRAMER: Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig, they, they test.

[George spits his bagel out]

GEORGE: Alright. Uh well, I'm out of here.

[He gets up to leave]

JERRY: Happy Festivus!

KRAMER: What's Festivus?

JERRY: When George was growing up...

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: His father...

GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!

[Elaine enters while George is exiting]

ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.

GEORGE: God!

[George leaves]

KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!

ELAINE: Kramer listen, I got a little phone relay going so if a guy calls H and H and he's looking for me, you take a message.

JERRY: You're still trying to get that free sub?

ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now.

JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?

ELAINE: Maybe.


[At the H and H Bagel Shop]

FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?

KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?

FRANK: Many Christmases ago I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had but so did another man. As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!

KRAMER: What happened to the doll?

FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"

KRAMER: That must of been some kind of doll.

FRANK: She was.


[At the Kruger Office Building]

[George is in the hallway dispensing his made-up gifts]

GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.

[He hands her a card]

SANDYHERRING: Oh... thanks.

[George passes an open doorway]

GEORGE: Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming!

[He flicks his card toward Phil]

[A voice is heard, "Ow!"]

[George meets up with Kruger]

GEORGE: Ah, Mr. Kruger, sir. Merry Christmas!

[He hands him a card]

KRUGER: Not if you could see our books. What's this?

GEORGE: The Human Fund.

KRUGER: Whatever.

[He walks off]

GEORGE: Exactly. Erica!


[At the H and H Bagel Shop]

[Frank is still telling Kramer about Festivus]

FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner you gather your family around and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.

KRAMER: Is there a tree?

FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.

KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.

FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.

[He turns to leave and meets up with Elaine]

ELAINE: Hello, Frank.

FRANK: Hello, woman.

ELAINE: Kramer! Kramer, any word from the vest?

KRAMER: No. Ah listen, Harry, I need the twenty-third off.

BAGELMANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.

KRAMER: But it's Festivus.

BAGELMANAGER: What?

KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.

BAGELMANAGER: That's not a right.

KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine.

[He takes of his apron and goes for his coat]

KRAMER: It's a walk out!

ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.

KRAMER: What? You're siding with management?!

ELAINE: No, I just...

KRAMER: Scab! Scab!

[He points at Elaine]

KRAMER: Scab!


[In a taxi cab]

[Gwen joins Jerry in the cab. She's in her attractive state]

GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: Boy am I glad to see you.

GWEN: You were expecting someone else?

JERRY: You never know.

GWEN: You know, you might want to take the tunnel.

JERRY: So uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?

[All the sudden Gwen is extremely ugly]

GWEN: I can go either way.

JERRY: You're telling me.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth?

JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.

GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.

JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?

GEORGE: Lights out.

JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links by the way.

GEORGE: Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!

JERRY: That's not a French cuff shirt, you know.

GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.

JERRY: Oh, that's classy.

[Frank and Kramer enter. Frank is dragging an aluminum pole]

KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus.

GEORGE: What is that? Is that the pole?!

FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage, its part of who you are.

GEORGE: That's why I hate it.

KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house, everyone's invited.

FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the cassette tapes.

[Franks pushes play. George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard]

FRANK: Read that poem.

GEORGE: I can't read it. I need my glasses!

FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!

ESTELLE: Leave him alone!

FRANK: Alright George, it's time for the feats of strength.

[George has a break down]

GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!

[He gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop]

GEORGE: I hate Festivus!

FRANK: We had some good times.

[Gwen walks in and greets Jerry. She's in her unattractive state]

GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: Hi there. This is Kramer and Frank.

GWEN: Hi.

[Kramer is shocked at her ugliness, he stammers]

KRAMER: Hello.

GWEN: So, you ready to go?

JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.

[They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive]

JERRY: Now this is a good looking booth.


[At the H and H Bagel Shop]

[Kramer is picketing out side]

KRAMER: Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels.

[He continues to chant]

[Inside the store]

BAGELMANAGER: Lady, if you want a sandwich I'll make you a sandwich.

ELAINE: I want the one that I earned.

[The phone rings]

ELAINE: I'll get it. I'll get it! H and H and Elaine.

[From a phone booth right outside the store]

KRAMER: Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.

ELAINE: What did you do?

KRAMER: You've been warned.

[Elaine looks out the window and sees Kramer at the pay phone]

ELAINE: Oh, hi!

[She waves at him]

[Steam starts coming from a pipe on the machine. Elaine hangs up]

BAGELWORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke.

BAGELMANAGER: Can we still make bagels?

BAGELWORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.

[Kramer knocks on the shop door]

KRAMER: Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!

[No one inside seems to care. Kramer waits by the door to see if anyone was affected]



[At the Kruger building]

KRUGER: George, I got something for you.

[He pulls a check from his pocket]

KRUGER: I'm supposed to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me so what's the difference?

[He hands the check to George]

GEORGE: Twenty thousand dollars?

KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund.

[He tries to enter his office but it's locked]

KRUGER: Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this place?

JERRY: Why? It's our place.

GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup.

JERRY: Oh, I know who's cooking today!

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hey! Surprise, surprise!

JERRY: Hey, Georgie!

GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go.

JERRY: I'll be here.

[Gwen leaves]

GEORGE: Hey, soup.

JERRY: She didn't touch it.

[George spoons through his soup and finds a rubber band]

GEORGE: Oh Paco!

[He flicks rubber band toward the kitchen]

GEORGE: Hey, take a look at this.

[He  hands Jerry Kruger's check]

JERRY: Twenty thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Excuse me?

GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.

JERRY: You want to give something back? Start with the twenty thousand dollars.

GEORGE: I'm serious.

JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?

GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist, a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money and people would love me. Then they would come to me and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! First thing I'm gonna need is a driver.


[Outside H and H Bagels]

[Kramer is chanting 'no bagels, no bagels..' Elaine walks out, her make-up is distorted and her face is pale because of the steam]

ELAINE: Kramer, the vest just called.

[Kramer is shocked by the way Elaine looks]

KRAMER: Yama hama! It's fright night!

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in ten minutes I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.

KRAMER: And?

ELAINE: Free sub. I'll see you.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[Gwen walks by, she's in her ugly state]

GWEN: Kramer, Hi!

KRAMER: Oh, hello.

GWEN: It's Gwen. We met at the coffee shop.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry.

KRAMER: Ah, I don't know who you really are but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend and she's not you. You're much better looking and like, a foot taller.

GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.

KRAMER: Oh, he's a tomcat.


[Cut to Elaine]

[She meets up with Denim Vest on the street corner]

ELAINE: Steve.

DENIMVEST: Hmm?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

DENIMVEST: From Tim Whatley's party?

ELAINE: Yeah.

DENIMVEST: You look... different.

ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. Do you have that card that I gave you?

DENIMVEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now. I'll give it to you later or something.

ELAINE: No no no, you give me your number.

DENIMVEST: Okay. Sure.

[He pulls out a pad and starts writing a number down]

DENIMVEST: Do you have the mumps?

ELAINE: No.

DENIMVEST: Typhoid?

ELAINE: No.

[He hands her the paper and runs off]

DENIMVEST: Yama hama!

[Elaine looks at the number and sees it's the same as the number on a nearby truck]

ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!


[At Kruger's office]

KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo here from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.

GEORGE: Well, there could be.

KRUGER: But there isn't.

GEORGE: Well I, I could uh, I could give the money back. Here.

[He holds out the check]

KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.

GEORGE: Well sir, I, I gave out the fake card because um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I um, I celebrate Festivus.

KRUGER: Venomous?

GEORGE: Festivus, sir. And uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, sir!

KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?

GEORGE: Oh no, sir. Festivus is all too real. And I could prove it if I had to.

KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.


[At the Costanza's house]

GEORGE: Happy Festivus!

FRANK: George? This is a surprise.

[He looks at Kruger]

FRANK: Who's the suit?

GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.

FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?

GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.

FRANK: He's gonna see it.

[Jerry and Elaine enter. Elaine is still ugly from the steam]

GEORGE: Happy Festivus!

[He sees Elaine]

GEORGE: Yama hama!

ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?

GEORGE: Embracing my roots.

JERRY: They nailed you on the twenty G's?

GEORGE: Busted cold.

[Kruger and Frank look at the Festivus pole]

FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength to weight ratio.

KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.

[Kramer enters]

[Kramer's with the two bookies from Horse Track Betting]

KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!

[He hugs George and jumps up and down]

KRAMER: He he he!

BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.

ELAINE: What are you doing here?

BOOKIE: Damnedest thing, me and Charlie were calling to ask you out and uh, we got this bagel place.

KRAMER: I told them I was just about to see you. It's a Festivus miracle!

[Estelle comes through the kitchen door hitting Kramer as she opens it]

ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!

FRANK: Let's begin.

[Everyone sits around the table. Kruger recognized Kramer from "The Meat Slicer" episode]

KRUGER: Dr. Van Nostrand?

KRAMER: Uh, that's right.

FRANK: Welcome new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!

GEORGE: Oh God.

FRANK: Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe... I lost my train of thought.

[Frank sits down. Jerry gives a face that says "That's a shame". Gwen walks in]

GWEN: Jerry!

JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here?

GWEN: Kramer told me.

KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!

[Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices Elaine]

GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.

ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for six hours. Give me a break.

[Gwen leaves, Jerry follows]

JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!

[He runs back to his seat]

JERRY: Bad lighting on the porch.

ELAINE: Hey, how'd my horse do?

BOOKIE: He had to be shot.

FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.

GEORGE: Not the feats of strength.

FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Uh, oh. Oh gee Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H and H.

JERRY: I thought you were on strike?

KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little...

[He makes a series of noises]

KRAMER: ...out there.

GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?

[Kramer leaves]

KRUGER: How about George?

FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me George, Festivus is not over!

GEORGE: Oh please, somebody stop this!

[Frank takes off his sweater]

FRANK: Let's rumble!

[Cuts to an outside view of the Costanza's house]

ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!

GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.

FRANK: Stop crying and fight your father!

GEORGE: Ow! Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!

FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!


[At the H and H Bagel Shop]

[Kramer is shaping some bagel dough while chewing gum. His gum falls out of his mouth and into the dough. He starts looking for the gum by pulling and pawing at the dough. The manger sees all this and approaches Kramer]

BAGELMANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired.

KRAMER: Thank you!

[He gets his coat and leaves]
