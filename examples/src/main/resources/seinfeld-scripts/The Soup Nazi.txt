[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is reading a newspaper while Jerry and Sheila are holding each other]

GEORGE: Alright, so what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got sixty-first and third or eighty-fourth and Broadway.

JERRY: Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?

SHEILA: You called me shmoopy. You're a shmoopy.

JERRY: You're a shmoopy!

SHEILA: You're a shmoopy!

JERRY: You're a shmoopy!

GEORGE: Alright shmoopies, what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.

JERRY: Uh, we'll go to Third Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?

SHEILA: No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.

[Elaine enters]

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Hey.

SHEILA: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi Sheila.

JERRY: Alright then, I'll see you later.

SHEILA: Bye shmoopy.

JERRY: Bye shmoopy.

[Elaine looks at George like, "give me a break"]

ELAINE: Okay. We ready to go?

GEORGE: Yes please, please let's go.

ELAINE: Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.

JERRY: No. We gotta go to the soup place.

ELAINE: What soup place?

GEORGE: Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.

JERRY: He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day and I tell you this, you will be stunned.

ELAINE: Stunned by soup?

JERRY: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.

ELAINE: Huh. Alright, let's go, come on.

JERRY: There's only one caveat. The guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.

ELAINE: Why? What happens if you don't order right?

JERRY: He yells and you don't get your soup.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.

GEORGE: Alright, alright let's, let's go over that again.

JERRY: Alright. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.

ELAINE: What?

[They leave the apartment]

[On the street]

JERRY: The main thing is to keep the line moving.

GEORGE: Alright. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.

JERRY: Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments, no questions, no compliments.

ELAINE: Oh boy, I'm really scared!

JERRY: Elaine.

ELAINE: All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi.

[She passes an armoire for sale on the street]

ELAINE: Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow!

ELAINE: How much is this?

FURNITUREGUY: I was asking two fifty, but you got a nice face. Two even.

ELAINE: Huh? Ha. Two hundred. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.

JERRY: He gave you the nice face discount.

ELAINE: Alright, you guys go ahead.

[George leaves to get his soup]

JERRY: What about the soup?

ELAINE: I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.

JERRY: Pardon.

[He leaves]


[At the soup stand]

GEORGE: This line is huge.

JERRY: It's like this all the time.

GEORGE: Isn't that that Bania guy?

[Jerry looks behind him to see Kenny Bania in line]

JERRY: Oh no, it is. Just be still.

GEORGE: Too late. I think he picked up the scent.

BANIA: Hey Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.

JERRY: Hard to believe.

BANIA: This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.

JERRY: Shh! Alright Bania, I'm not letting you cut in line.

BANIA: Why not?

JERRY: Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.

BANIA: Okay okay.

[George and Jerry enter the soup stand]

[George approaches the counter apprehensively and puts his money down]

[The Soup Nazi stares at him without speaking]

GEORGE: Medium turkey chili.

[George steps to the cash register as Jerry approaches the counter]

JERRY: Medium crab bisque.

[The Soup Nazi dishes up the soup. The cashier hands George his soup]

GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.

JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.

GEORGE: Excuse me, I, I think you forgot my bread.

SOUPNAZI: Bread two dollars extra.

GEORGE: Two dollars? But everyone in front of me got free bread.

SOUPNAZI: You want bread?

GEORGE: Yes please.

[The Soup Nazi shouts and holds up three fingers]

SOUPNAZI: Three dollars!!

GEORGE: What?

SOUPNAZI: No soup for you!

[He snaps his fingers]

[The cashier snatches George's soup from him and gives him back his money. George looks at Jerry, stunned. Jerry points his thumb outside, gesturing for George to leave]


[On the street in front of Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.

ELAINESSUPER: Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.

ELAINE: But I didn't know, Tom. I, can't you just make an exception please? I've got a nice face.

ELAINESSUPER: Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tomorrow. I'll even give you a hand, alright?

ELAINE: Oh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.

FURNITUREGUY: I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.

[He walks away]

ELAINE: Oh no, please don't go. Please, please don't walk away.


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry is eating his soup while George stares at him]

JERRY: Oh, man. Oh! This is fantastic! How does he do it?

GEORGE: You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any.

JERRY: I gave you a taste. What do you want?

GEORGE: Why can't we share?

JERRY: I told you not to say anything! You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!

GEORGE: Do you hear yourself?

JERRY: I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.

GEORGE: Well, I gotta go back there and try again.

[Sheila enters]

SHEILA: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi Sheila.

SHEILA: Hi shmoopy.

JERRY: Hi shmoopy.

SHEILA: No, you're a shmoopy!

JERRY: You're a shmoopy!

GEORGE: I'm going.

JERRY: Hey listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?

GEORGE: You know what? I changed my mind. I uh, I don't think so.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: I just don't feel like it anymore.

JERRY: Just like that?

GEORGE: Just like that.

[He leaves]

SHEILA: Boy he's a weird guy, isn't he?

[Kramer enters abruptly]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

[Kramer takes Jerry's couch cushion and goes to leave]

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Hey hey hey hey hey hey. What are you doing?

KRAMER: Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night. I'm gonna guard it for her.

[He points to the cushion under his arm]

KRAMER: I need something to sit on.

JERRY: Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.

KRAMER: Yeah, but this is so nice and thick.

[He gives Sheila a smile and leaves]


[In front of Elaine's apartment]

KRAMER: Ahoy there!

ELAINE: Oh Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, you ask for it, you got it.

ELAINE: Do you need anything?

KRAMER: Well, a bowl of mulligatawny would hit the spot.

ELAINE: Mulligatawny?

KRAMER: Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.

ELAINE: Oh who? The soup Nazi?

KRAMER: He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. You know, most geniuses are.

ELAINE: Alright, I'll be back.

KRAMER: Oh, wait a second. You don't even know how to order.

ELAINE: Oh no no no no. I got it.

KRAMER: Elaine!

ELAINE: Hey, I got it.

[She leaves]


[In front of the soup stand]

[George is standing in line practicing his ordering technique. Elaine approaches]

ELAINE: Hey. Didn't you already get soup?

GEORGE: No I didn't get it.

ELAINE: Why? What happened?

GEORGE: I made a mistake.

[Elaine laughs]

GEORGE: Alright, well we'll see what happens to you.

ELAINE: Yeah. No listen George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?

ELAINE: Oh I know! It is awful!

GEORGE: Why do they have to do that in front of people?

ELAINE: I don't know.

GEORGE: What is that with the shmoopy?

ELAINE: Oh!

GEORGE: The shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy!

ELAINE: Oh! Stop it! I know.

GEORGE: I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.

ELAINE: Ugh!

GEORGE: And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.

ELAINE: You know, we should say something.

GEORGE: You know, we absolutely should.

ELAINE: I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?

GEORGE: I know, he can be so weird sometimes.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: I still haven't figured him out.

ELAINE: No, me neither.

GEORGE: Alright, shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.

ELAINE: Oh God!

[They enter the soup stand]

[George approaches the counter and puts his money down]

GEORGE: Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go.

[He side steps to the cashier. Elaine looks at him pathetically. The cashier hands him his soup in a bag and George examines it]

GEORGE: Bread. Beautiful.

SOUPNAZI: You're pushing your luck little man.

GEORGE: Sorry. Thank you. Thank you

[Elaine approaches the counter]

ELAINE: Hi there. Um, uh...

[She rests both arms outstretched on the counter and starts drumming with her hands on the metal countertop]

ELAINE: Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and um... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?

SOUPNAZI: Yes.

ELAINE: Never been a big fan. Um, you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "Scent Of A Woman."

[She makes annoying "who ah" sounds]

SOUPNAZI: Very good. Very good. You know something?

ELAINE: Hmm?

SOUPNAZI: No soup for you!!

ELAINE: What?

SOUPNAZI: Come back one year!

[Elaine looks shocked]

SOUPNAZI: Next!


[In front of Elaine's apartment]

[Two men approach the armoire and start inspecting it]

CEDRIC: Look at this.

BOB: It's an antique.

CEDRIC: It's all hand made and I love the inlay.

BOB: Yes. Yes me too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No no, pick it up from the bottom over there.

KRAMER: Wait wait wait. What are you doing?

BOB: What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.

KRAMER: You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.

BOB: Look, you wanna get hurt?

KRAMER: Huh?

BOB: I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.

CEDRIC: Bob.

BOB: Just pick it up.

KRAMER: What is this, huh?

BOB: You have some kind of problem here!? What is it you not understanding!? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?

[Kramer reacts spastically]

[Bob and Ray pick up the armoire and leave. Kramer sits down on his cushion and watches them]


[On the street]

[George is eating his soup and Elaine walks next to him]

ELAINE: I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states attorney office. I really am.

GEORGE: Oh this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.

ELAINE: Alright. Alright, give me a taste.

[She tastes the soup]

ELAINE: Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down.

[She sits down]


[In front of Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: What happened? Where's my armoire?

KRAMER: It was stolen.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, these street toughs, they robbed me.

ELAINE: Street toughs took my armoire?

KRAMER: Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.

ELAINE: I can't believe this!

KRAMER: Well where's the soup?

ELAINE: What? The Soup Nazi threw me out.

KRAMER: Oh... yeah!!

[He leaves with his cushion]


[At the soup stand]

[Jerry and Sheila are next in line and hugging each other]

JERRY: What are you gonna get?

SHEILA: I'll decide at the last minute.

JERRY: Well you better decide sister, you're on deck.

[She kisses him]

JERRY: Sheila!

[The Soup Nazi starts pounding on the countertop]

SOUPNAZI: Hey!

JERRY: Uh oh.

SOUPNAZI: What is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!

SHEILA: I can kiss anywhere I want to!

SOUPNAZI: You just cost yourself a soup!

SHEILA: How dare you? Come on Jerry, we're leaving.

[She storms out. Jerry remains inside trying to decide what to do. Sheila marches back in for Jerry]

SHELIA: Jerry?

[He stares at the Soup Nazi, then at Sheila]

JERRY: Do I know you?

[Sheila is aghast]


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?

JERRY: It was a bisque.

ELAINE: Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly George has become much more normal than you.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE: Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.

JERRY: Have you tasted the soup?

ELAINE: Yeah, alright you made the right decision.

JERRY: See, the way I figure it it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.

[Kramer enters]

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Hey.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He returns the couch cushion]

JERRY: Oh, thanks.

ELAINE: There he is.

KRAMER: Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.

ELAINE: Yeah. I know. Me too.

JERRY: So, did these thieves want any money?

KRAMER: No.

JERRY: They just wanted the armoire?

KRAMER: Yeah. They were quite taken with it.

[The intercom buzzes]

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: Hup! Hup!

JERRY: Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?

ELAINE: No. In what way?

JERRY: I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me or something.

ELAINE: I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hello.

JERRY: Hello.

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hello.

ELAINE: Hello.

GEORGE: Were you just talking about me? What's going on?

JERRY: Absolutely not.

GEORGE: Something's going on here.

KRAMER: Alright, I'm gonna go get some soup.

ELAINE: One of these days that guy is gonna get his.

GEORGE: So, how was the movie?

JERRY: Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah?

[He tries to contain his joy]

JERRY: Yeah. What, what are you, happy?

GEORGE: Happy? Why should I be happy?

[Elaine gets up off the couch]

JERRY: I don't know, but you look like you're happy.

GEORGE: Why should I care?

JERRY: You can't fool me. Don't insult me George because I know when you're happy.

GEORGE: Alright I am happy and I'll tell you why.

[Elaine opens the door and sneaks out]

GEORGE: Because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right Elaine?

JERRY: Is that so?

GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!

JERRY: Disgusting?

GEORGE: People who do that should be arrested.

JERRY: Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.

GEORGE: Yeah. And we had a pact, you know.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: You shook my hand in that coffee shop.

JERRY: You're still with the pact?

GEORGE: Mmm hmm. You reneged.

JERRY: All I did was shake your hand.

GEORGE: Ah ha!!

[He points at Jerry]


[At the soup stand]

[Kramer is standing by the cashier talking to the Soup Nazi]

KRAMER: And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.

SOUPNAZI: Oh, this city.

NEWMAN: One large jambalaya, please.

[He side steps to the cashier and hand his money over. Kramer nods at him]

SOUPNAZI: So, continue.

KRAMER: Well, my friend is awfully disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.

[Newman takes his soup]

NEWMAN: Thank you.

[He exits the soup stand. Once on the street he stops and opens the bag to inhale deeply]

NEWMAN: Jambalaya!

SOUPNAZI: Alright, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.

KRAMER: How can I possibly thank you?

SOUPNAZI: You are the only one who understands me.

KRAMER: You suffer for your soup.

SOUPNAZI: Yes. That is right.

KRAMER: You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.

SOUPNAZI: How can I tolerate any less from my customer?

[Another customer attempts to order his soup]

SOUPCUSTOMER: Uh, gazpacho, por favor.

SOUPNAZI: Por favor?

SOUPCUSTOMER: I'm part Spanish.

SOUPNAZI: Adios muchacho!

[The customer stares at Kramer in disbelief]

KRAMER: Git.

[He points to the door]


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: It was stupid of me.

SHEILA: Well, it was very insulting.

JERRY: No. I know. I, I was really sort of half kidding.

SHEILA: Well, behind every joke there's some truth.

JERRY: What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says, "Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.

SHEILA: Well, I guess you're right.

JERRY: So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?

SHEILA: Yes, shmoopy.

JERRY: Aw!

[Susan and George enter, George tries unsuccessfully to steer her to another table besides the one Jerry and Sheila are at]

SUSAN: Hey, Jerry!

JERRY: Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.

GEORGE: Oh yes, hello.

SHEILA: Hello. Won't you join us?

GEORGE: No thanks.

SUSAN: Of course.

GEORGE: Yes, well...

[Susan and George sit down across from Jerry and Sheila]

GEORGE: So uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?

JERRY: Yeah, that's right. You got a problem?

GEORGE: I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty.

JERRY: Well, we're changing the rules.

GEORGE: Ah, good for you.

SUSAN: Uh, what are you getting George?

GEORGE: I don't know, honey. What do you want to get?

[He leans over and puts his arm around her and starts talking in baby voice]

GEORGE: I want you to get anything you want. Because I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?

SUSAN: Oh George, you're so sweet.

GEORGE: Well, I could be a little sweetie tweety tweety tweety.

SUSAN: Aw!

[They snuggle closely together]

JERRY: What about you, shmoopy?

[He puts his arm around Sheila]

JERRY: How about a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?

SHEILA: Yeah.

JERRY: Yum yum little tuna fishy?

GEORGE: Come here.

[George and Susan begin making out. Jerry and Sheila begin making out in order to keep up]


[At Elaine's apartment]

[Kramer has his hands over Elaine's eyes]

KRAMER: Whala!

[He removes his hands so she can see the new armoire]

ELAINE: Oh!

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!

KRAMER: Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?

ELAINE: The K Man did it!

KRAMER: Yeah!

ELAINE: How much did you pay for this thing?

KRAMER: How about zero?

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?

KRAMER: I'll tell you where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the soup Nazi.

ELAINE: Get out!

[Elaine pushes hard on Kramer's chest, causing him to fall backwards through her swinging door and onto the floor]

ELAINE: The soup Nazi gave it to you?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Why?

KRAMER: Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it.

[He gets up off the floor rubbing his shoulder]

KRAMER: Yeah, he's a wonderful man.

[Elaine gasps]

KRAMER: Yeah, well a little bit misunderstood but uh...

ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!

KRAMER: Yeah, well he's a dear.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: How much tip do you leave on eight fifteen?

SUSAN: You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.

GEORGE: Huh?

SUSAN: Because you love your little kiki don't you?

[George has a look on his face like, "what have I started?"]


[At the soup stand]

[Bania is getting some soup]

SOUPCUSTOMERTWO: How is he today?

BANIA: I think he's in a good mood.

[Elaine is at the counter]

ELAINE: Hi. Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

SOUPNAZI: You? If I knew it was for you I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!

[Elaine turns away and the camera pans to the person behind her. He has a look on his face like, "uh oh"]


[On the street]

JERRY: I'm heading over to Elaine's.

KRAMER: Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.

JERRY: Those two?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Are you sure?

KRAMER: Yeah. That's them.

JERRY: Let's confront them.

KRAMER: No no no, let's get a cop.

JERRY: There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.

KRAMER: No!

JERRY: Let's go.

[He drags Kramer forward]

[Bob and Ray are looking in a store window]

BOB: Oh wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.

CEDRIC: Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.

BOB: Oh please, do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.

KRAMER: Excuse me.

CEDRIC: Are you talking to me?

KRAMER: Uh, well, uh...

CEDRIC: I said, are you talking to me?

BOB: Well maybe he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!

KRAMER: Well uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?

[Kramer and Jerry stare at each other briefly then turn around and run away]


[At Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a soup Nazi.

[Jerry takes some papers out of the armoire]

ELAINE: What? What is that?

JERRY: I don't know. "Five cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, three pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."

[Elaine takes the papers from Jerry]

ELAINE: Let me see this. You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this.

[She takes more papers from the armoire]

ELAINE: There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: So? His secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have them published! I could, I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.

[Elaine tries to leave]

JERRY: Wait a second, Elaine.

[He blocks her]

JERRY: Where do you think you're going?

ELAINE: What do you care?

JERRY: Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.

ELAINE: Get out of my way, Jerry.

JERRY: Elaine, let the man make his soup!

ELAINE: Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.


[On the street in front of a store window]

SUSAN: Look, they have it in blue for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?

GEORGE: Oh, yes. I, I'm your baby bluey.

SUSAN: Oh yeah.

[She snuggles George]

[Jerry walks up]

JERRY: Well well.

SUSAN: Hi Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Susan, George.

SUSAN: You know, I really like Sheila a lot.

JERRY: Oh, really? Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.

SUSAN: Oh no! That's too bad.

JERRY: Yeah, well, she was very affectionate which I love. You know I love that. But mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah too bad, because you gotta have the affection which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.

SUSAN: Uh huh.

GEORGE: You did?

JERRY: Oh yeah. But the mentally we just couldn't make the connection. But anyway. I'll see you.

[He leaves]

GEORGE: Yeah. See you.


[At the soup stand]

[Elaine waits to confront the Soup Nazi while he berates a customer]

SOUPNAZI: Go on! Leave! Get out!

SOUPWOMAN: But I didn't do anything.

SOUPNAZI: Next!

ELAINE: Hello.

SOUPNAZI: You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.

ELAINE: I don't want soup.

[She waves the papers in her hand]

ELAINE: I can make my own soup. "Five cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, three pounds celery."

SOUPNAZI: That is my recipe for wild mushroom.

[He tries to grab the papers but Elaine snatches them away]

ELAINE: Yeah, that's right. I got them all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.

SOUPNAZI: Mulligatawny?

ELAINE: You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!


[On the street]

[Newman comes running along]

NEWMAN: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

JERRY: What is it?

NEWMAN: Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!

JERRY: What, what's the matter?

NEWMAN: Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for any of us!

JERRY: Well, where are you going?

NEWMAN: He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!

[Newman takes off running. Jerry thinks for a second then takes off running]
