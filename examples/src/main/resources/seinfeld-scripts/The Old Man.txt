[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: The life expectancy now is uh, seventy-two I think for men, seventy-five or six or something for woman. It's amazing to think that just a couple thousand years ago life expectancy was thirty. Which in our terms would mean that you get your driver's license around five, married at nine, divorced at fifteen. In your late teens you move down to Florida. I guess that's how Spring break got started, I don't know. And eventually people saying things about you like, "Well, it's amazing he's twenty-eight but still very alert. His mind is so sharp you would think you were talking to a two year old.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: Oh, what's the point? When I like them they don't like me. When they like me I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the way I do with the ones I don't like?

JERRY: Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll all be over.

GEORGE: Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.

JERRY: Yeah, how about a mute?

GEORGE: A mute would be good.

JERRY: Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?

GEORGE: This is what my life has come to, trying to meet a mute.

[George quickly shifts into deep philosophical mode. Jerry remains pedestrian on the issue, still reading the paper]

GEORGE: I don't know Jerry, something's missing. There's a void Jerry, there's a void.

JERRY: A deep, yawning chasm.

GEORGE: There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?

[Jerry thinks for a second]

JERRY: Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.

[Elaine enters and greets George and Jerry cheerfully]

ELAINE: Hey boys!

JERRY: Hey! How you doing?

ELAINE: Good. Okay well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.

GEORGE: Start what?

ELAINE: I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.

GEORGE: Really.

ELAINE: Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel so good! I really feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.

GEORGE: Volunteer work, huh?

JERRY: What're you gonna do down there?

ELAINE: Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I don't know, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.

JERRY: That's what I do with him.

[He points at George]

[George gives Jerry that "Oh, ha-ha... it is to laugh" look and probes Elaine further]

GEORGE: When did you get this idea?

ELAINE: Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going on and on and on about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.

JERRY: What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?

GEORGE: And... and anybody can do this?

ELAINE: Yup.

GEORGE: Helping people. Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I not be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, dammit!

ELAINE: What about you?

JERRY: Nah, it's not for me.

ELAINE: Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.

GEORGE: What kind of a person are you?

JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful.


[We skip forward to the apartment where a representative from the senior citizens office is giving George and Jerry their information sheets on their volunteer cases]

AGENCYREP: This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.

GEORGE: Well, I feel better already. I'm feeling like a good person.

AGENCYREP: Good luck.

JERRY: Thank you.

[The rep leaves and George and Jerry compare information sheets]

GEORGE: Hey, what's your guy's name again?

JERRY: Fields. Sidney Fields. Eighty-seven years old. Eighty-seven. How about your guy?

GEORGE: Ben Cantwell. Eighty-five. Huh... you think we'll make it to that age?

JERRY: We? No.

[Kramer enters and claps his hands together]

KRAMER: So what's up, diggity dog?

JERRY: George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.

KRAMER: Oh that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.

JERRY: What're you talking about?

KRAMER: Oh Jerry, I'm surprised at you!

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: It's a con! These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists, bilking people out of their life savings, oh yeah!

JERRY: Where do you get this?

KRAMER: The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.

[Before Kramer can get too far into his tale a commotion is going on outside the door at Kramer's apartment. Someone's knocking on his door]

NEWMAN: Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?

KRAMER: I'm in here. Come on.

[Newman enters the apartment]

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: Jerry, George. So, did you ask him about the records?

KRAMER: Well?

JERRY: What records?

KRAMER: Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.

[Kramer and Newman slap high fives together several times]

NEWMAN: You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!

KRAMER: Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, you know, old fashioned useless records, you know, just lying around.

KRAMER: You know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.

[Before Jerry issues a response, George needs his curiosity satisfied]

GEORGE: Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?

NEWMAN: I'm a United States postal worker.

GEORGE: Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?

NEWMAN: Sometimes.

JERRY: Why is that?

NEWMAN: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's Publisher's Clearing House day!!!

JERRY: Alright! Alright! Just take the records. There in the bedroom, take anything you want.

[Newman and Kramer head for the bedroom but stop briefly to slap a high five together]


[At Bleeker Record Store]

RON: I'll give you five bucks.

KRAMER: Five bucks?

NEWMAN: Well, you know how much those records are worth!?

RON: Yeah, I do... five dollars.

NEWMAN: Those records are worth more than five dollars!

[Kramer leans in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: He's gypping us.

NEWMAN: You're gypping us!

RON: Well, what do you got here, you know, you got "Don Ho: Live At Honolulu", you got "Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs", you got Sergio Mendes, now come on...

KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.

NEWMAN: They follow him like a cult.

KRAMER: He can't even walk down the street in South America.

RON: Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.

[Kramer leans in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: I don't like it.

NEWMAN: I don't like it.

RON: Well, then get the hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.

KRAMER: Alright, well be back, jack.

NEWMAN: Alright, well be back... jack!


[At the home of Sid Fields. Sid sits in an armchair while his housekeeper answers the door. Sid is not the jolly fellow one might associate with someone of his mellowing years]

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.

HOUSEKEEPER: Agency?

JERRY: Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?

HOUSEKEEPER: Sid Fields.

[The Housekeeper points over to the E-Z Chair where Sid is sitting. He welcomes Jerry into his home]

OLDMANSID: What the hell is it?

JERRY: Mr. Fields?

OLDMANSID: What!?!

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.

OLDMANSID: Agency? What agency? The CIA?

JERRY: No no, the...

OLDMANSID: Who let you in here?

JERRY: The woman, she...

OLDMANSID: Oh her. She steals from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My ass she doesn't speak English. Plays that freaking voodoo music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the hell out of my house.

JERRY: Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.

OLDMANSID: Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to kill me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!?

[Jerry gets out his driver's license]

JERRY: No, Mr. Fields, look, really I'm...

OLDMANSID: I can't read that you fool.

[Jerry is in the pocket and he's in trouble. Attempting to avoid the sack he scrambles and picks another topic to switch to. There are a couple of piles of records on top of the TV. Jerry asks about them]

JERRY: What's all this stuff?

OLDMANSID: Trash. Garbage.

JERRY: You're throwing this out??

OLDMANSID: I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.

JERRY: You don't want any of this?

OLDMANSID: Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, Einstein.

JERRY: You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.

OLDMANSID: Well, take it. I'm sure as hell not going to give it to my family.

JERRY: Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...

OLDMANSID: With you? I'd rather be dead.

JERRY: Well, maybe I'll get going then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.

OLDMANSID: Good. Thank God. Good riddance. Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? Ha!!


[At Monk's Cafe. George and his charge enjoy a bowl of soup over some conversation]

BEN: No, I feel great for eighty-five.

GEORGE: You know the average life span for an American male is like, seventy-two. You're really... kind of pushing the envelope there.

BEN: I'm not afraid of dying. I never think about it.

GEORGE: You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinking about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinking about it until it drives me insane.

BEN: I'm grateful for every moment I have.

GEORGE: Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're so close to the end? When you know that any second, Poof! Bam! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic for Gods sake.

BEN: I guess I just don't care.

GEORGE: What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any sense?! Don't you have a brain?! Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talking about Anymore?!

[Ben gets up to leave]

GEORGE: Wait a second, where are you going?

BEN: Life's too short to waste on you.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, please...

BEN: Get out of my way.

[As Ben shoves George out of the way, all of a sudden you just have to feel a tinge of pain in your heart as you realize George realizes he won't be able to talk to Ben anymore]

GEORGE: But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup.


[The apartment of Elaine's senior citizen. It's very dark in the apartment]

ELAINE: Mrs. Oliver?

MRSOLIVER: Yes my dear.

[Elaine looks around the room, trying to find Mrs. Oliver. She pans around and wham-o!! She sees that Mrs. Oliver has a rather, um, unsightly physical problem to put it mildly]

ELAINE: Oh!

MRSOLIVER: What's the trouble? Are you alright?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

MRSOLIVER: It's my goiter, isn't it?

ELAINE: Did you say goiter? What goiter?

MRSOLIVER: This football shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.

ELAINE: Oh, that goiter. Hey... What do you know.

MRSOLIVER: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: Bother me? Oh, why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothing, it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, you know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. Really.


[At Jerry's apartment, they compare notes on their visits]

JERRY: Come on Elaine, it's just a goiter.

ELAINE: I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinking that that goiter's gonna start talking to me. You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there, "Oh, by the way, this woman almost has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.

JERRY: They really should mention that in the breakdown, height, weight, goiter.

ELAINE: You know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I'll tell you, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.

ELAINE: Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?

GEORGE: I don't think it's gonna work out.

JERRY: What do you mean?

GEORGE: He fired me.

JERRY: He fired you?!?

ELAINE: How do you get fired from a volunteer job?

GEORGE: I don't know. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!

JERRY: Well, I don't know about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.

ELAINE: I wish I could quit.

JERRY: So quit!

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter. I was raised to give up.

[Kramer and Newman come in, albums in hand]

KRAMER: Well, here's your albums.

JERRY: What happened?

NEWMAN: Five dollars. He offered us five dollars.

KRAMER: Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You embarrassed me at that store.

NEWMAN: That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.

JERRY: Oh yeah, you and your Sergio Mendes.

KRAMER: Hey hey hey hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!

[Elaine relieves herself of the conversation by going to the bathroom]

JERRY: Well you should have seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away. Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...

KRAMER: Wait wait wait, now... he's throwing them out??

JERRY: Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.

KRAMER: Okay.

NEWMAN: The old coot's sitting on a mountain of gold!

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: But you're going to have to go get them. I'm not carrying them all.

KRAMER: Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm going there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal. Wild wild stuff...

[George peeks up from the magazine he's reading on the couch]

GEORGE: Senegal?


[At Mr. Fields apartment. George is helping the housekeeper put away some groceries. He takes this time to get to know her better]

GEORGE: So you don't speak any English at all?

HOUSEKEEPER: English? No.

OLDMANSID: Hey, what are those bums doing back there?

JERRY: Well you said they could come and take the records.

OLDMANSID: It's like watching a couple of hyenas going through the garbage.

GEORGE: You don't speak any English?

HOUSEKEEPER: No English.

GEORGE: I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!

JERRY: So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is...

OLDMANSID: Hey, I don't like what's going on around here. I want all you bums out of here.

KRAMER: Now calm down, Mr. Fields...

OLDMANSID: Now don't tell me to calm down! Get your hands off of me! Why you little...

KRAMER: Ow! He's biting me!

[Kramer's defense mechanism kicks in and when he rips his arm away from Sid's jaws of death, something flies away from the scrum]

OLDMANSID: My teeth! My teeth!

JERRY: Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!

GEORGE: I thought I saw something fly over here...

JERRY: Well turn the light on...

[George flicks the light switch by the kitchen sink]

JERRY: That's the garbage disposal!

OLDMANSID: My teeth! You idiots!

[The boys decide to take Sid to the dentist to get new teeth, or something but on the way to the cab, somebody forgot to stay with Mr. Fields. They go back to find him, but they can't, apparently]


[Cut to Mrs. Oliver's place where Elaine is sitting, bored out of her skull through a very pedestrian conversation. She keeps mumbling to herself throughout Mrs. Oliver's story]

MRSOLIVER: And we would take long automobile trips...

ELAINE: Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun.

MRSOLIVER: Staring out the window...

ELAINE: Uh huh...

MRSOLIVER: You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and...

ELAINE: Well, that'll get you going right there...

MRSOLIVER: Big, roaming cows...

ELAINE: Cows, well that's fascinating...

MRSOLIVER: That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.

ELAINE: What?

MRSOLIVER: Mohandas.

ELAINE: Gandhi?

MRSOLIVER: Oh, the passion. The forbidden pleasure.

ELAINE: You had an affair with Gandhi?

MRSOLIVER: He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look.

[She shows Elaine a picture of the two together]

ELAINE: Oh my God... the Mahatma?


[Back at Ron's on Bleeker, Kramer and Newman have brought Ron the clerk "something decent"]

RON: Twenty bucks.

NEWMAN: Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?

RON: Well, take it or leave it.

NEWMAN: Take it or leave it!? We got Al Jolson here, Al Jolson!!

RON: Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing "Mammy".

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: This guy's nothing but a piece of crap.

NEWMAN: You are nothing but a piece of crap.

RON: Pardon me?

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: A piece of crap.

NEWMAN: A piece of crap.

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: I find you extremely ugly.

NEWMAN: I find you extremely ugly.

RON: Do you?

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.

NEWMAN: You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.

RON: Oh, is that right?

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: I loathe you.

NEWMAN: I loathe you.

RON: That's it. Get out of my store!

[Kramer speaks in Newman's ear]

KRAMER: Make us.

NEWMAN: Make us!

RON: Oh, I'll make you!

[Ron jumps the counter to get at them]


[At Jerry's apartment]

AGENCYREP: Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single handedly destroyed our reputation.

JERRY: Yes, but...

[The door buzzer sounds]

JERRY: [Into the intercom] Yes?

TIMFIELDS: It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields son.

JERRY: Alright, come on up.

JERRY: I don't know what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.

AGENCYREP: Why were you taking him to the dentist?

JERRY: Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal.

AGENCYREP: What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?

JERRY: Well, after he bit my friend...

AGENCYREP: Bit your friend?!

[Tim comes into the apartment. The agency rep goes to the phone]

TIMFIELDS: What the hell is going on here? How do you lose a human being?!

JERRY: I, I'm sorry.

TIMFIELDS: And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?

JERRY: Well, I brought them up there to take his records.

TIMFIELDS: Take his records? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?

[Kramer and Newman come into the apartment]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: There you are. Did you find him?

KRAMER: No, you know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to screw us so we got in a fight.

NEWMAN: It was a real melee.

KRAMER: Yeah, a real brouhaha.

NEWMAN: All the records broke.

TIMFIELDS: The records broke!? My father's records!!?

AGENCYREP: Did anybody try and call him?

JERRY: Yeah, I called him but there's no answer.

AGENCYREP: Well the lines busy now.

TIMFIELDS: The lines busy! He must be home!

[Everyone leaves]


[At Sid Field's home. The door opens and everyone enters. The lights are off and African music is playing. Time turns the light on to find George sitting on the couch with the housekeeper. George is in his boxer shorts leaning over while she rubs oil on his head. They look over to see everyone staring at them]

GEORGE: We, we uh, we, we couldn't find him.


[At Monk's Cafe]

OLDMANSID: What the hell's the point? When you like them they don't like you and when they like you you don't like them.

BEN: You don't know what you want. You should see a psychiatrist.

OLDMANSID: I got fixed up last week

BEN: I never would get fixed up.

OLDMANSID: I go to pick her up and she opens the door and she's got this huge goiter growing out of the side of her neck. Look like a football.

BEN: What did you do?

OLDMANSID: Well, we, we get to talking and as it turns out, the woman knew Gandhi. We talked for hours

BEN: Well, are you going to see her again?

OLDMANSID: We were getting along real good, then she made some tea. Put some milk in it without asking me. Now that's a turn off.

BEN: No, you don't need that.


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: The thing about old people is that their bodies get smaller, they move into smaller places, they sleep less time, they eat smaller meals, except the car. The older they get the bigger the car gets. I never understood that. And old people have a way of backing out of the driveway, you know what I mean? They don't turn from side to side, they just go, "I'm old, I'm awake a long time, I'm backing it out, you know? I'm coming back. Watch out buddy, I'm coming. You better watch out." And then once they get out there they drive so slowly. I would think the less time you have in life, the faster you would want to go. I believe old people should be allowed to drive their age. If you’re eighty, do eighty. If you’re a hundred, go a hundred. They can see where their going anyway, let them have a little fun out there.
