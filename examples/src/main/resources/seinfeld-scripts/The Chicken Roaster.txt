[George and Jerry are on the side of the street at a fruit stand]

GEORGE: Why is there no haggling in this country?

JERRY: I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.

GEORGE: Not me. Everything should be negotiable.

JERRY: Restaurants too?

GEORGE: Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.

JERRY: Yeah, especially zedi with that big hole.

[George asks the store worker a question]

GEORGE: Excuse me, how much is this?

GROCERYVENDER: Dollar nineteen.

GEORGE: I'll give you a quarter.

GROCERYVENDER: Get the hell out of here.

JERRY: Tell him forty and no fork.

GEORGE: Thirty.

GROCERYVENDER: That's it, you leave and never come back!

JERRY: How about we leave and come back in a week?

GROCERYVENDER: Deal!

GEORGE: Alright see? We got something there.


[Kramer and Jerry and on the side of the street talking about the new chicken shack]

JERRY: Look at the size of that neon light.

KRAMER: Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.

JERRY: He is the gambler.

KRAMER: Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.

JERRY: Try and stay calm.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

[Kramer leaves]

[A man on the street recognizes Jerry]

SETH: Hey, Jerry!

JERRY: Seth! Wow, what has it been like five years?

SETH: At least.

JERRY: You wanna grab lunch?

SETH: Uh, I'm actually headed back to the office.

JERRY: Seth it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?

SETH: Well, I am supposed to be in this meeting.

JERRY: Blow it off. Remember Poly Sci? How many of those did we go to?

SETH: Alright, alright.

JERRY: Whatever happened to Moochie?

SETH: He's dead.

JERRY: Is that right?


[George and Elaine are in a store]

GEORGE: I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me a business expense.

ELAINE: What do you think of the catalog?

GEORGE: It stinks.

ELAINE: There, we just talked business.

SALESWOMAN: We do have the down comforter and the cookware you liked.

ELAINE: Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.

SALESWOMAN: You know what else we have that you might like?

ELAINE: I'll take it.

[George puts on a giant Russian hat]

GEORGE: Hey, you like?

[Elaine laughs]

SALESWOMAN: I think that looks very nice on you.

GEORGE: Really? Elaine... Peterman account?

ELAINE: Why not? And some hair for my little friend here.


[Jerry and Seth are eating at a restaurant]

SETH: So how's your stand up career?

JERRY: Pretty good. As a matter of fact, I almost had my own show in Japan.

SETH: You speak Japanese?

JERRY: No.

SETH: So you would have done it in Japan, but in English.

[Jerry thinks for a minute]

JERRY: I don't know. So what's this job of yours?

SETH: Big investment firm. We just got the Citibank account. In fact today was our first big meeting with them.

JERRY: The meeting you blew off?

[Seth laughs]

SETH: Yeah.

JERRY: Wasn't that kind of important?

[Seth pauses to think, and then gets worried]

SETH: Yeah.


[Jerry and Elaine are talking on the phone]

ELAINE: And I brought I whole new set of cookware and a water pic.

JERRY: You use a water pick?

ELAINE: Sure, water pic, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.

JERRY: So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?

ELAINE: Well, at the latest. Oh, hang on a second, I gotta another call.

ELAINE: Hello?

IPSWITCH: Good day Ms Benes, this is Roger Ipswitch.

ELAINE: Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?

IPSWITCH: Ms. Benes, I noticed you have been charging quite a bit of merchandise on the Peterman account.

ELAINE: Well, I am the President.

IPSWITCH: Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never the less the expense account is for business purposes only.

ELAINE: Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?

IPSWITCH: No, I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow. Good day.

ELAINE: Good day.

[Elaine and Roger hang up, leaving Jerry still on hold]

JERRY: Hello? Anybody?


[George walks into Monk's Cafe wearing the Russian hat]

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, why didn't you get the big one?

GEORGE: This hat just bottles in the heat, I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!

JERRY: I don't believe it.

GEORGE: And I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.

JERRY: Ah, too bad you got a little George Costanza thing going on.

GEORGE: I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.

JERRY: That's a date?

GEORGE: What's the difference? You know they way I work, I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, you hum it in the shower, by the third date it's "By Mennen!"

JERRY: How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?

GEORGE: If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, glove, scarf, I go back to her place to pick it up... date number three.

JERRY: That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?


[Jerry is at his apartment door]

JERRY: "By Mennen."

[Jerry notices a red dot shining on his door. He traces it to Kramer's peep hole. Jerry then knocks on Kramer's door. When the door is opened a huge red light is seen. Kramer is standing there smoking away on a cigar]

JERRY: What's going on in there?

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: The light!

KRAMER: Oh the red. It’s the chicken roaster sign, its right across my window.

JERRY: Can't you shut the shades?

KRAMER: They are shut. Oh yeah, your friend Seth stopped by.

JERRY: Yeah? What'd he say?

KRAMER: He was fired.


[Cut to Elaine's office. Elaine is trying to convince the accounting guy that all of her expenses are business related]

ELAINE: Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. So what do you think?

IPSWITCH: Another bull’s-eye.

ELAINE: Well Mr. Ipswitch, since every one of my expenses is obviously for a legitimate business purpose.

[Elaine turns on water pic to water plants]

IPSWITCH: I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.

ELAINE: The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?

IPSWITCH: Because it costs eight-thousand dollars.

ELAINE: What?

[She hits Roger with water from water pic]


[Jerry is talking to Seth at his apartment]

JERRY: Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?

SETH: We're old college buddies.

JERRY: I only knew you through Moochie.

SETH: Hey Jerry, don't worry about it, the important thing is that we got to catch up. Mind if I grab the want ads?

JERRY: Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.

[Seth leaves. Kramer comes over and hits the wall]

JERRY: How's life on the red planet?

KRAMER: It’s killing me. I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken.

JERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?

KRAMER: Ah, they gave me the heave ho. I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.

[Kramer gets out a bowl, fills it with cereal and then retrieves the tomato juice from the fridge]

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Getting some cereal.

JERRY: That's tomato juice.

[Kramer takes a big spoonful of cereal with tomato juice]

[He spits out the cereal]

KRAMER: That looked like milk to me! Jerry my rods and cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it! I gotta move in with you Jerry.

[Kramer tries to dump the cereal in the garbage but spills it on Jerry's wall]

JERRY: I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that...

[He then cleans it with a dish rag]

JERRY: ...living together after a while we might start to get on each others nerves a little.

[Kramer squeezes juice from rag the into the container and puts it back in fridge]

KRAMER: Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we switch apartments?

JERRY: Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.

KRAMER: Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!

JERRY: Yeah, that's no good.

KRAMER: I may have to drive that place out of business.

JERRY: How you gonna do that?

KRAMER: Like we did in the sixties, taking it to the streets.

[Kramer opens door and nearly falls backward from the neon light eminating from across the hall]



[George is dropping off the woman that sold him the hat]

HEATHER: Thanks George, but I got it from here.

GEORGE: Oh no, I'm in already come on.

[George puts down the bags he came in with]

GEORGE: So you want to get together tomorrow?

HEATHER: No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

GEORGE: What about this weekend?

HEATHER: I'm gonna be busy for a while.

[George throws his keys on the table]

GEORGE: Okay, see you!

HEATHER: Hey, you forgot your keys.

GEORGE: What? Those aren't my keys.

HEATHER: Well, they're not mine.

GEORGE: Oh, they are my keys, how weird.

HEATHER: Bye George.

GEORGE: Yeah.

HEATHER: George, bye!

[George places his hat on her chair behind a pillow]

GEORGE: Costanza.


[George and Elaine are in Elaine's office. George is looking at a bunch of fake butterflies mounted in a picture frame on the wall]

ELAINE: What do you mean you don't have the hat?

GEORGE: I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

[He bangs on the glass picture]

ELAINE: No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!

GEORGE: Alright, alright. I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha. Now watch the magic.

[George tries to dial but gets a busy tone]

ELAINE: Dial nine Merlin.

[George dials again and Heather picks up the phone]

HEATHER: Hello?

GEORGE: Heather Hi, it’s George Costanza.

HEATHER: Oy.

GEORGE: Ah listen, I don't mean to bother you but, silly me, I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.

HEATHER: You didn't leave a hat here.

GEORGE: I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair... accidentally.

HEATHER: No hat. George I gotta go.

GEORGE: You know maybe I'll...

[Heather hangs up]


[Jerry is walking down the street and sees Seth emptying garbage for Kenny Roger's chicken shack]

JERRY: Seth?

SETH: Jerry Hi! What do you think?

JERRY: I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.

SETH: Yeah, I'm the new manager

JERRY: But your were an executive, this is fast food.

SETH: Not fast food, good food served quickly.

[Kramer opens his window revealing a banner saying "BAD CHICKEN"]

KRAMER: Hey, stay away from the chicken! Bad chicken! Mess you up!

SETH: That's not going to be good for business.

JERRY: That's not going to be good for anybody.


[Kramer and Jerry are talking in Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out. I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.

[Jerry holds up a doll]

KRAMER: Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

JERRY: And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...

[Jerry is interrupted by the sound of a toilet flush, out comes Newman from the bathroom]

JERRY: Oh no.

NEWMAN: Nice place you got here Kramer. A man can really get some thinking done.

JERRY: Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.

[Jerry puts on giant sunglasses and goes to Kramer's apartment. Newman starts eating chicken]

KRAMER: What is that? Roger's Chicken? Oh get that out of here.

NEWMAN: I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.

KRAMER: Well I'm boycotting it.

[Kramer looks at the chicken]

KRAMER: What is that, hickory?

NEWMAN: Yeah, it's the wood that makes it good.

KRAMER: Really?

NEWMAN: Uh huh.

[Kramer reaches for some and Newman snaps at him like a dog]

KRAMER: Oh stop it.

[Kramer takes some chicken and eats it. He looks like he loves it]


[A knock on Heather's door]

HEATHER: Can I help you?

[Its Elaine. While she is talking she is dragging George in by pulling on his ear]

ELAINE: Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend of George Costanza's. Whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.

HEATHER: Really?

ELAINE: I know, he has a real confidence problem.

GEORGE: Well not really.

ELAINE: George. Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But I really do need to have that hat back.

HEATHER: Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over but...

GEORGE: Well that makes sense.

ELAINE: Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?

HEATHER: Be my guest.

[George is being dragged in by his ear from Elaine]

GEORGE: Good to see you again.


[George and Elaine exit the apartment looking tired]

GEORGE: She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere.

ELAINE: This is an absolute disaster.

GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. Check this out.

[George holds up a golden clock he had hidden in his jacket]

ELAINE: You stole her clock?

[George smiles]

ELAINE: Well done.

GEORGE: Yep, this one for our side!


[Cut to Jerry's apartment. Kramer is in Jerry's bed eating Kenny Roger's Chicken. He wipes his face on Jerry's sheets and doing so found another piece of chicken. Kramer throws it on the floor]


[Cut to Kramer's apartment. Jerry is wide awake in the dark]

JERRY: What is that creaking? Its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.

[There's the sound of a door opening]

JERRY: Hello, is somebody there? Mr. Marbles?


[In the morning at Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I gonna do?

KRAMER: You should sleep with him.

[Jerry enters doing a Kramer slide. His hair is like Kramer's]

JERRY: Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep! You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!

[He rubs his eyes with his hands]

ELAINE: You look a little stressed.

JERRY: Oh I'm stressed!

ELAINE: So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.

JERRY: You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

ELAINE: I thought he was Kramer's friend.

JERRY: Well, he called last night about three AM. We got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.

ELAINE: Forty bucks? Are they Sable?

JERRY: No, but the difference is unnoticeable.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I like this idea.

ELAINE: Alright, let’s give it a shot, let’s go.

JERRY: Giddy up!

[Elaine and Jerry leave. Newman reveals himself, he was hiding in the bathroom]

NEWMAN: It's getting cold, it's getting cold.

KRAMER: That was a close one.

NEWMAN: Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?

KRAMER: If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.


[Back to Elaine's office]

IPSWITCH: Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Nutria.

ELAINE: Well, that's a kind of sable.

IPSWITCH: No, it’s a kind of rat.

ELAINE: That's a rat hat?

IPSWITCH: And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.

ELAINE: But, but he's in the Burmese jungle.

IPSWITCH: Yes, and quite mad from what I hear.

ELAINE: Wait? Can I fire you?

IPSWITCH: No.


[At Monk's Cafe. George and Kramer are eating together]

KRAMER: So Heather called?

GEORGE: Yeah, but get this, the message said '"call me if you have the time". If I have the time, you get it?

KRAMER: No, but this is all very exciting.

GEORGE: She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my hat, I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.

KRAMER: Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.

GEORGE: I've looked at that, seems unlikely.

KRAMER: I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?

GEORGE: I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Even since he moved into that apartment he's too much... like you.

KRAMER: That's a shame.


[Jerry enters Kenny Rogers]

JERRY: Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?

SETH: Jerry I lied, I'm just the assistant manager.

[He speaks into the microphone]

SETH: Number sixty-seven, family feast.

[Newman jumps up]

NEWMAN: Number sixty-seven, right here, right here!

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.

SETH: And don't forget your steamed broccoli.

JERRY: Hold it. Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.

NEWMAN: I love broccoli, its good for you.

JERRY: Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?

[Jerry opens the container. Newman takes a piece]

NEWMAN: Gladly.

[Newman puts it in his mouth and chews for a few seconds. He then spits it out spastically]

NEWMAN: Vile weed!

JERRY: It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?

NEWMAN: Yes, now please! Someone, honey mustard!

[Newman bangs on the counter repeatedly. Seth brings him a small container of honey mustard. Newman drinks it down like a stiff drink then turns and leaves]


[At Jerry's apartment. Kramer is waiting for Newman. Jerry comes in]

KRAMER: Newman, what took you so long? Oh, hey buddy.

JERRY: Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find him at Kenny Roger's Roasters.

KRAMER: Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.

JERRY: He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people as long as one of them is not him.

KRAMER: Oh hey, Elaine stopped by. Yeah, dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah, well thanks for stopping by.

JERRY: I sure do miss my apartment, maybe I'll switch back.

KRAMER: Oh you don't want to think about that, no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and run that Roger's right out of town.

JERRY: I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble, I'll do it myself.

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, you leave those roasters alone, Kenny never hurt anybody!

JERRY: You got a little problem.

KRAMER: Oh, I got a big problem Jerry!


[Elaine is visiting Peterman in the Burmese jungle. Elaine is brought in and told to sit]

PETERMAN: Elaine.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman.

[A boy cuts a piece of fruit in the background. Peterman scolds him in another language]

ELAINE: You speak Burmese?

PETERMAN: No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble finding the place?

ELAINE: No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood.

PETERMAN: Are you an assassin?

ELAINE: I work for your mail order catalog.

PETERMAN: You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.

ELAINE: Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just sign this expense I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.

PETERMAN: I'd be happy to Elaine.

[He looks at the bill]

PETERMAN: But I will have to see this hat.


[George and Heather are at a bench in the park. George is holding a bag]

GEORGE: So how do you want to do this?

HEATHER: Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went out I found you very irritating. But after seeing you for a couple of times you sort of got stuck in my head. Costanza!

GEORGE: So you really don't have my hat?

HEATHER: What?

[George moves his bag]

GEORGE: Oh, let's go do something.

HEATHER: What's in bag?

GEORGE: That's a sandwich.

[The clock starts ringing]

GEORGE: Damn salami.

HEATHER: My clock, you stole it!

GEORGE: That damn deli! That is last time they screw up one of my orders.

[It starts raining]


[Jerry enters Kenny Rogers Roasters. The rain has made the rat hat which he was wearing wet]

JERRY: Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there.

[As Jerry talks he tries to wave his rat hat dry because of the wetness. The hat falls apart into everyone's plate]

JERRY: Oh gross. That's not gonna be good for business.

SETH: That's not gonna be good for anybody.


[Kramer is in bed eating chicken when the Kenny Roger's chicken light goes out]

KRAMER: Kenny? Kenny?


[Kramer is at his window with a sign saying "Come Back Kenny"]

KRAMER: Kenny... Kenny...


[Jerry is in bed at his own apartment]

JERRY: Home at last.

[A creaking noise is heard]

JERRY: Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?


[Elaine is with Peterman in the jungle. He is lying down. She shows him the new catalog]


ELAINE: It’s the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog.

[He turns his head to look at it then turns away] 

PETERMAN: The horror... the horror.
