[At a car dealership] 

[Jerry and George are looking over some cars] 

GEORGE: When are they gonna have the flying cars, already? 

JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.

GEORGE: Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner. 

JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.

GEORGE: No. That's just electric. 

JERRY: What about Harrison Ford? He had one in uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one. 

GEORGE: What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? 

JERRY: Well, what do you think the big holdup is? 

GEORGE: The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production. 

JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? 

GEORGE: And the underwater bubble cities? 

JERRY: It's like we're living in the fifties here. 

[Kramer is bouncing up and down on the rear bumper of one of the cars for sale] 

KRAMER: It's good suspension! 

JERRY: Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey George, I'm buying this car.

[He gestures to a black Saab] 

GEORGE: Shh. What is wrong with you? You never tell them you like the car. You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here. 

JERRY: You're getting that vein again. 

GEORGE: I'm starving. We should have had lunch first.

JERRY: It'll be twenty minutes. I told you, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. 

GEORGE: Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic. 

JERRY: I guess he graduated. 

GEORGE: There's an easy move. Go from screwing you behind your back to screwing you right to your face. 

[Kramer is in one of the cars. He honks the horn] 

JERRY: Thank you. 

GEORGE: Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh? You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, you're on your back like a turtle. 

JERRY: Alright. Calm down. 

GEORGE: My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I'm getting dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shouting at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker!" 

[Kramer is now on his back under a car] 

KRAMER: Jerry, I don't think this thing is hooked up right. 

[Jerry and George go to enter the office buildings] 

JERRY: Alright, we're going in. 

[A salesman walks up to Kramer. He's still under the car] 

SALESMAN: You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease? 

[Kramer emerges from under the car] 

KRAMER: Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying.

RICK: Maybe I should talk to him. 

KRAMER: Oh, I don't think so. No, he's an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That's where I come in. 

RICK: I see. So, you're his manager? 

[Kramer hops into the car] 

KRAMER: Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh? 


[Insides the dealership building. Jerry and George are waiting for a salesman to assist them]

GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk out. No matter what they say, you say, "I'll walk out of here right now!" 

[A salesman approaches] 

SALESWOMAN: Can I help you with something? 

GEORGE: Hold it! One more step and we're walking! 

JERRY: George. Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy. 

GEORGE: He is. You don't know what I'm doing here. 

[Elaine walks into the showroom with David Puddy] 

ELAINE: Hey. 

JERRY: Hey. 

PUDDY: Sorry I'm late. 

ELAINE: My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion. 

JERRY: Ah. Where did you go? 

ELAINE: Uh, to a restaurant. 

PUDDY: Arby's. 

ELAINE: I had the roast beef.

JERRY: So Puddy, I decided I'm gonna go with another nine hundred convertible. 

PUDDY: Alright. Classic.

[He holds his hand up]

PUDDY: High five. 

ELAINE: David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is? 

PUDDY: Oh sure, babe. Salesman only copy room, right there. 

ELAINE: Oh.

[She leaves] 

PUDDY: Hey, come on guys. I'll show you the nine hundred. 

GEORGE: Yeah, you show us the nine hundred. 


[Kramer is in the car with the salesman Rick. They're driving an unknown street]

RICK: And look at these features, Mr. Kramer. Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, make a right at this corner, please. An adjustable steering wheel and oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn. 

KRAMER: No no no, I didn't. 

RICK: Well, that's okay. We'll make this next right and swing around to get back to the dealership.

KRAMER: Well, it's a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I'm gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it'll handle my daily routine. 

RICK: Well where are we going? 

KRAMER: Just a little place I like to call, "You'll see". 


[In Puddy's office] 

[George and Jerry are in conference with Puddy] 

GEORGE: I'm starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up? 

PUDDY: By the service department. 

GEORGE: Alright, remember, no rust proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak, mumble.

JERRY: Au revoir, Le George. 

GEORGE: Don't think it can't happen!

[He leaves] 

JERRY: So Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey". 

PUDDY: I don't care for that term. 

JERRY: Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.

PUDDY: No, I don't know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector. 

JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language. 

PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh, Koko. 

JERRY: Yeah, Koko. 

PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimp's alright.

[He holds up his hand]

PUDDY: High five. 

[Returning, George sees Jerry reluctantly slap hands with Puddy] 

GEORGE: Hey hey hey! What's going on here? You didn't agree to anything, did you? 

JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey. 

GEORGE: Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh! 

PUDDY: Well, there's a vending machine. I could show you where it is.

GEORGE: Hey, give me a dollar. 

JERRY: Where's your money? 

GEORGE: I'm here helping you. 

[Elaine enters] 

ELAINE: Hey. Where's Puddy? The copy machine is broken. 

GEORGE: Heh, heh, heh. That's what they want you to think. 

JERRY: Hey Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit? 

[She wquints, imitating Puddy]

ELAINE: The squinting? 

JERRY: No. 

[She stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy]

ELAINE: The staring? 

JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high five. 

ELAINE: I thought all guys do that. 

JERRY: Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on, they're doing sign language now. 

ELAINE: It's that bad? 

JERRY: What do you think the Nazis were doing?

[He imitates the Nazi's salute]

JERRY: That was the heil five. 

ELAINE: Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago? 

JERRY: It was a good bit in the eighties and it's still relatable today. 

[Puddy approaches them] 

PUDDY: Good news. We got a nine hundred in black. That's the hot color.

[He holds up his hand]

PUDDY: High five. 

[Elaine and Jerry exchange looks] 

ELAINE: Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.

[Elaine takes Puddy's arm leading him to the room] 

PUDDY: You owe me five. 


[In the dealership back room] 

[George is eyeing a Twix candy bar through the vending machine glass] 

GEORGE: Twix. B five. 

[George put in his dollar but the machine rejects it. He tries to jam it in, same result. He tries one more time, unsuccessful]

GEORGE: Ah, come on! 

[A heavy-set mechanic approaches and stands in line behind George to use the vending machine. George steps back to let him use it. The machine readily accepts the mechanic's dollar] 

GEORGE: Ah, excuse me. Do you have uh, change of a dollar? 

MECHANIC: No. 

GEORGE: Could I uh, could I trade you for another dollar? 

MECHANIC: Don't have one. 

GEORGE: Ah, excuse me. When your uh, when your wallet was open, I, I glanced inside and I couldn't help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills. 

MECHANIC: You're incorrect. 

GEORGE: Perhaps you could look again, please? I'm very hungry. 

MECHANIC: We had donuts earlier. 

GEORGE: I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You're all doing a hell of a job!

[He looks longingly at the Twix in the machine]

GEORGE: Ho, ho. What I would do with you.


[Rick and Kramer are still on the test drive. The back seat is filled with various items, those including a giant, stuffed Tweety bird] 

RICK: Uh, Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed to use the cars to run errands. 

KRAMER: Now look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car that my celebrity friend is considering my full endorsement.

[He looks out the window]

KRAMER: Oh, let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas.

[He yells out to them]

KRAMER: Hey, Ladies!

[He points to the car]

KRAMER: It's the Saab nine hundred! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?!

[They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face]

KRAMER: Geez.


[In the dealership back room] 

[Jerry walks up to the vending machine. George is on his stomach reaching under the vending machine for change] 

JERRY: I think the candy comes out over there. 

GEORGE: People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they're too lazy to pick it up. 

JERRY: Either that or they've got a weird little hang up about lying face down in filth. Why don't you just go to the cashier? 

[George gets up] 

GEORGE: The cashier is at lunch which is where I'd like to be. 

JERRY: How much was under there? 

GEORGE: I think something bit me. I just need another nickel. 

JERRY: Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think?

[He hands him a nickel] 

GEORGE: Ho ho ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in! 

JERRY: Hey, can I have my dollar back? 

GEORGE: It's wrinkled. It's worthless. 

[Jerry gives George a look, then leaves. George hurriedly puts the money into the machine] 

GEORGE: Ha ha ha ha!

[The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine]

GEORGE: Come on! Jump! 

[A man holding a donut walks past George] 

MAN: They just put out some more donuts. 

GEORGE: They did? 

MAN: Last one. 


[Kramer is still on the road with Rick] 

KRAMER: Well, just one more errand and we can head back. 

RICK: Actually, it looks like we're gonna need some gas. 

KRAMER: Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now? 

RICK: Well, it's on E. 

KRAMER: You know Rick, oftentimes Jerry, he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I don't want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline. 

RICK: So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend's car for free. 

KRAMER: Well, I make it up to him in other ways. 


[In the dealership back room] 

[George enters with a salesman regarding the machine] 

GEORGE: As you will see the candy bar is paid for and yet remains dangling in the machine. 
[He notices that the Twix slot is completely empty]

GEORGE: Hey, it's gone. Where is my Twix?

[He quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar]

GEORGE: What?! That guy's eating it! 

SALESMAN: Well, how do you know that one's yours? 

GEORGE: Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must've bought one and gotten both. 

SALESMAN: Sir, are you gonna buy a car? 

GEORGE: No!

[The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door's window]

GEORGE: Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix!

[The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works]

GEORGE: Oh, ha ha! Ho ho! 


[Puddy is in the copy room with Elaine. He's trying to fix the Xerox machine]

PUDDY: Paper jam. Got it! 

ELAINE: Yay!

[Puddy holds his hand up]

PUDDY: High five.

[Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around and puts his hand out behind his back]

PUDDY: On the flip side. 

ELAINE: David, um, I... 

PUDDY: Don't leave me hanging. 

ELAINE: You're a salesman now and the high-five is, it's very “grease monkey.” 

PUDDY: What did I tell you about that? 

ELAINE: Ah, I, I'm sorry, but the high five is just so stupid. 

PUDDY: Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid. 

ELAINE: Oh, that is really mature. 

PUDDY: Yeah? So are you. You're the grease monkey. 

ELAINE: Uh, that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving. 

PUDDY: Yeah, if you leave, we're through. 

ELAINE: Fine! We're through! 

PUDDY: Oh, so you're leaving? 

ELAINE: That's right.

[Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up]

ELAINE: High five!

[She turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done]

ELAINE: On the flip side!

[As Elaine is leaving she mutters to herself]

ELAINE: Taking me to Arby's...

JERRY: Hey! Where are you? 

[She leaves. Puddy sits down at his desk disturbed] 

PUDDY: Let's finish this up. 

JERRY: Did you two break up? 

PUDDY: That chick's whacked. We're history. I just left out a couple of things, uh, rust proofing... 

JERRY: "Rust-proofing"? 

[Puddy reads off what he's adding up on the calculator]

PUDDY: Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder's fee...

JERRY: "Finder's fee"? It was on the lot! 

PUDDY: Yeah, that's right. Uh, floor mats, keys...

JERRY: “Keys”?! 

PUDDY: How you gonna start it? 


[In the dealership's shop] 

[George catches up with the portly mechanic] 

GEORGE: Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar you got a little freebie and you never bothered to ask why or seek out its rightful owner. 

MECHANIC: First of all, it wasn't a Twix. It was a Fifth Avenue bar. 

GEORGE: Huh. You must think I'm pretty stupid.

[The mechanic shoots him a look as if he clearly does think he's stupid]

GEORGE: That was no Fifth Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that is a cookie and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch. 

MECHANIC: It's uh, it's just a little nougat. 

GEORGE: Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So let's not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications. 

MECHANIC: You know, you're getting a little vein there. 

GEORGE: I know about the vein! I can't believe this guy.

[Jerry rushes in with a box of candy] 

JERRY: Hey, George! 

GEORGE: Hey, starving!

[He grabs the box from Jerry] 

JERRY: No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he's treating me just like a regular customer now! 

GEORGE: I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen. No, ho ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There's no laws in this place. Anything goes! It's Thunderdome! 

[A saleswoman approaches them] 

SALESWOMAN: Is someone helping you? 

GEORGE: Stay back!

[He runs out of the room pushing Jerry out ahead of him]


[Kramer and Rick are driving the car] 

RICK: Where is it now? 

KRAMER: There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the E. 

RICK: How low are you gonna go? 

KRAMER: Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just...

[He makes a popping sound]

KRAMER: ...put it out of your mind. 

RICK: Have you ever been completely below the slash? 

KRAMER: Well, I almost did once and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch and the tank was full. I don't know who did it and I never got to thank them.

RICK: Mr. Kramer, the road! 

[Kramer swerves around trying to get back in place] 

KRAMER: Whoop! Whoop! 


[In Puddy's office] 

[Jerry and George are in conference] 

JERRY: So listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball I got my friend George here and he can play pretty hard ball. George, vein it up. 

GEORGE: Alright Puddy, listen and listen good. I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?! 

JERRY: George! Can we focus on the car here? 

GEORGE: I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine. 

PUDDY: Jerry, I just need your signature here and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go. 

JERRY: Yellow? I wanted black. 

PUDDY: I can't give you black at that price. 

JERRY: George, would you help me, please? 

GEORGE: Yes. This is wrong! 

JERRY: Sing it, sister! 

GEORGE: Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch...

JERRY: Oh God. 

GEORGE: ...does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this! 

[Jerry follows George out the office] 

JERRY: I'll be right back. 

PUDDY: Okay. 

[Jerry catches up with George] 

JERRY: Hey, George! 


[In the car with Kramer and Rick. The needle is now below E. Rick is looking at it] 

RICK: Is it just the angle I'm looking from? 

KRAMER: No sir. We are down there. 

RICK: Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I've never felt so alive! 

KRAMER: Alright, I'm satisfied. We better get some gas. 

RICK: What? Well, we can't stop now. 

KRAMER: What do you mean? 

RICK: We have to keep going all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan. 

KRAMER: There was no plan. 

RICK: Well, let's make it the plan! Let's just go for it! Like Thelma and Louise. 

KRAMER: What, they drove to a dealership? 

RICK: No, they drove off a cliff. 

[Kramer eyes Rick, frightened] 

KRAMER: You are one sick mama. I like it. 

RICK: Mr. Kramer, the road! 

[Kramer swerves around again] 

KRAMER: Yup! Yup! 


[In Elaine's apartment] 

[The phone rings, she answers it] 

ELAINE: Hello? 

JERRY: Elaine, you've got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwing me on this car, which is yellow now! 

ELAINE: Who is this? 

[Jerry bangs the phone against the booth]

JERRY: Elaine! 

[Elaine flinches with every loud banging noise] 

ELAINE: What?! 

JERRY: You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal. 

ELAINE: You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry. 

JERRY: You're gonna get back together, anyway. It's thousands of dollars! 

ELAINE: Oh, I don't know. 

JERRY: Come on. Then you don't have to see him again till my fifteen thousand mile check. 

ELAINE: Well, will you pay my cab fare out there? 

JERRY: Fine. 

ELAINE: And I didn't like that roast beef, so how about some lunch? 

JERRY: No. No lunch. 

ELAINE: I'll hang this phone up right now! 

JERRY: Alright! Lunch! 

ELAINE: I'll see you.

[She hangs up the phone] 

JERRY: Bye.

[He hangs up] 

JERRY: Everybody's ripping me off! 


[George is at the customer complaint window]

GEORGE: Yes, I'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics. 

WILLIE: When did you bring the car in? 

GEORGE: Yeah right, I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet? 

WILLIE: Sir, what exactly is the problem? 

GEORGE: One of your guys, Kip, or Ned, short name, stole my Twix candy bar! 

WILLIE: Are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you? 

GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs. 

WILLIE: I thought you said it was a Twix. 

GEORGE: Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a Fifth Avenue bar. 

WILLIE: Maybe it was. 

GEORGE: Oh, no no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. 

WILLIE: What about the Hundred Thousand Dollar bar? 

GEORGE: No. Rice and caramel. 

WILLIE: Nougat? 

GEORGE: No. 

WILLIE: Positive? 

GEORGE: Please. 

[A woman appears from behind the window] 

WOMAN: You know they changed the name from Hundred Thousand Dollar bar to Hundred Grand? 

GEORGE: All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired! 

[An old man sitting in a nearby chair speaks up. He's Willie's father] 

WILLIESR: I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel. 

[The man behind George speaks up] 

MAN: What's the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial? 

GEORGE: They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! 

WILLIESR: Not Skittles. 

WILLIE: Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don't talk. 

WOMAN: You make your father sit here all day? 

WILLIE: He likes it! 

GEORGE: Alright, do you mind? I have the window! Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix? 

MAN: Twix has too much coconut. 

GEORGE: No! There's no coconut! 

WOMAN: I'm allergic to coconut. 

WILLIE: I'm not. 

WILLIESR: A nickel! 


[In the dealership office showroom] 

[Elaine enters and hands Jerry the receipt for her cab] 

ELAINE: Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy. 

PUDDY: I'm with a customer. 

[Elaine throws up her hands giving a face of disgust and starts to walk away] 

ELAINE: Uh. 

JERRY: No no no, Elaine, the car can wait. What's important is you two getting back together. Uh, then we'll talk about the car.

PUDDY: I don't want to get back with her. She's too bossy. 

ELAINE: David.

JERRY: Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on.

[All three sit down]

JERRY: Now look, you both find each other attractive, right? 

ELAINE: Right.

PUDDY: Right. 

JERRY: Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you. 

ELAINE: I guess. 

PUDDY: Good point. 

JERRY: Alright. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today? 


[At a gas station] 

[Kramer pulls the car into a gas station and gets out] 

KRAMER: Cars can go on empty but not us humans huh, fella? I'll get us a couple of Twix bars. 

RICK: No, no coconut for me. 

KRAMER: Alright, I'll get you a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running. 

[Rick sits back in the car a second then hurriedly jumps out and reaches for the gas pump. Kramer pops up from behind the pump and scares him] 

RICK: Ah! 

KRAMER: No man! Not the gas! 

RICK: But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad! 

KRAMER: Do you think that this'll make you happy? Because it won't! 

RICK: Ah, you can just go on without me. 

[Kramer grabs him by the collar] 

KRAMER: Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!" 

[The car makes sputtering noises] 

RICK: Maybe we better get moving. 

KRAMER: It's good to have you back, Stan. 

[Both hop into the car] 

RICK: It's Rick, by the way. 

KRAMER: No time! 


[In the dealership's customer service room] 

WILLIE: Mr. Costanza, I really don't have time for this. 

GEORGE: Now, if this mechanic guy was in fact eating a Fifth Avenue bar as he claims, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line up? 

WILLIE: "Candy line up"? 

GEORGE: I've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from. 

WILLIE: It took you an hour? 

GEORGE: Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you... the candy line up.

[He opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars] 

SALESWOMAN: Hey Willie, check it out! Free candy! 

GEORGE: That's my candy line up! Where are all my cards?! They're, they're all on the floor! 

[George starts picking up the numbered cards from off the floor. He sees the mechanic eating one of the candy bars] 

GEORGE: And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, eight Twix?! 

MECHANIC: No. 

MAN: Hey, this Clark bar is good. 

GEORGE: It's a Twix! They're all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell you! And you've robbed it! You've all screwed me again! Now, give me one! Give me a Twix! 

MECHANIC: They're all gone. 

[George yells out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle]

GEORGE: Twix!! 


[Elaine, Puddy, and Jerry are all in conference]

ELAINE: What was that? 

PUDDY: There's a mental hospital right near here. 

JERRY: Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle. Arby's no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game and doesn't read a book. 

ELAINE: Yeah, well, that's not bad. 

PUDDY: I can live with that. 

JERRY: So, you're back together? 

PUDDY: Yeah. 

[Jerry sees them stare at each other, smiling] 

JERRY: Alright alright alright, that's enough! Let's get back to my deal. That undercoating, that's a rip off isn't it, David? 

PUDDY: Oh, we don't even know what it is. 

JERRY: So, I'm getting the insider's deal? 

PUDDY: Insider's deal.

[He holds up his hand]

PUDDY: High five. 

[Jerry gives a face of resentment] 


[Rick and Kramer are driving back to the dealership] 

RICK: There's the dealer! 

KRAMER: Hey! 

RICK: We did! We pulled it off! I can't believe it! Where's the needle? 

KRAMER: Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo hoo hoo! 

RICK: Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I, I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now. 

KRAMER: Well, that's a weird thing to say.

RICK: I wonder how much longer we could have lasted. 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I wonder... hmm. 

[They both eye each other then lock hands. Kramer slams on the gas and they both cheer and scream as they drive on] 


[In a NYC cab] 

[Elaine, George, and Jerry are riding home in a cab] 

ELAINE: This is nice. What kind of car is this? 

CABDRIVER: Caprice Classic. 

ELAINE: You couldn't just give him one high five? 

JERRY: And where does it end? Then everyone's doing it. It's like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Don't go there." Someone's gotta take a stand! 

[George is eating a burger]

GEORGE: This Arby's is good. 

ELAINE: So George, I still don't understand, how was that a setup? 

JERRY: And who were you trying to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager? 

GEORGE: I don't know. All of them. They're all crooks! Besides, I couldn't get all different candy bars, anyway. 

[Kramer and Rick speed by the cab in the Saab both screaming and yelling] 

GEORGE: What was that? 

JERRY: I think there's a mental hospital near here. 

ELAINE: Very near. 


[Kramer and Rick are in the car still yelling. They slowly come to a stop]

KRAMER: Ya hoo! Ya hoo! Whew! Well, I think we stopped. 

RICK: You, you can probably let go of my hand now. 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll think about it.

[Kramer gets out of the car]

RICK: Do you have my card?
