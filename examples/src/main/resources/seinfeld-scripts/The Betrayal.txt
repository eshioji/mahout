[The final Castle Rock screen shows and the end credits roll]

[At Monk's Cafe. George, Elaine, and Jerry enter with suitcases. Elaine has a large bandage on her nose. They all sit down at a booth. All three of them are tired, fed up, and angered]

GEORGE: So Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!

ELAINE: George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.

GEORGE: Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.

GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!

[Kramer comes in and sits down at the booth with them]

JERRY: I said I was sorry.

GEORGE: You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY: Would you please stop saying that?!

KRAMER: What is up with you two?

GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.

KRAMER: So how was the big trip?

JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!

[Kramer observes Elaine's bandaged nose]

KRAMER: Well, what happened to your nose?

ELAINE: I don't want to talk about ow it!

KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?

ELAINE: She... was.

JERRY: Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.

KRAMER: Oh, that sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it.

[He gets up and heads for the bathroom]

GEORGE: You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.

JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!


[In India]

[On the screen. India - One Day Earlier]

[People storm out of a building. All are dressed in wedding apparel]

SUEELLEN: That's it! The wedding's off.

PINTER: What? But, Sue Ellen...

SUEELLEN: Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with my Pinter?!

ELAINE: No no no! It was years ago before you met him. And, and I, I got to tell you it was very mechanical.

SUEELLEN: I have never been so humiliated!

ELAINE: Idiots! This is all your fault!

GEORGE: Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!

JERRY: George, I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!

JERRY: I don't know what that means.

GEORGE: Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?

NINA: Alright. Neither.

GEORGE: What?! Well, what are you doing here?

NINA: A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five six.

GEORGE: Five eight! Five seven!

ELAINE: See? See the way they are?! We're, we're still best friends, right?

SUEELLEN: No. And take that stupid thing out of your nose!

[Elaine screams in pain as Sue Ellen pulls the stud out]

JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!

GEORGE: What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.


[In a building in India. The wedding ceremony is about to start]

[On the screen. Fifteen Minutes Earlier]

[The bride, Sue Ellen, and the Groom, Pinter, are walking down the aisle. Elaine is scattering flowers behind them. Jerry walks in and takes a seat]

ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: What happened last night?

JERRY: Oh, you were pretty loaded.

ELAINE: I know. I woke up with this.

[She shows her nose stud]

JERRY: Oh. Hello, tetanus.

[Nina and George enter the wedding hall]

NINA: George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.

GEORGE: No no no no, I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here. I'll sweat it out.

ELAINE: Hey.

[She looks at his shoes]

ELAINE: Are those Timberlands painted black?

GEORGE: Is your nose pierced?

ELAINE: I should...

[She walks toward the bride and groom]

GEORGE: Yeah.

[He points to two open seats in front of Jerry]

GEORGE: Sit down there.

[He sees Jerry]

GEORGE: Hello, Jerry. I believe you know Nina.

JERRY: George, we need to talk.

GEORGE: I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!

JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.

GEORGE: That's all?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!

JERRY: I'm really sorry.

GEORGE: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY: Where'd you get that one?

GEORGE: It's an expression.

[From the front of the room, Elaine can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion] 

ELAINE: Hey! Shh!

[She crosses herself, then shakes her head, apologizing]

GEORGE: Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!

JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.

GEORGE: Funny guy!

[Elaine quickly makes her way to Jerry and George scattering flower petals as she goes. She throws some at them]

ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!

GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

ELAINE: I'm not gonna sleep with you.

GEORGE: Reparations!

ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him, he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.

GEORGE: You slept with the groom?!

[Everyone goes silent. George and Elaine both look sheepishly. All eyes on them, especially Sue Ellen]

[On the screen. Four Hours Earlier - Back In New York]

[Kramer is standing up against a brick wall. All the sudden, he's pegged straight in the face with a snowball. He winces from the pain and coldness, then walks up to his friend FDR - the one who threw the snowball at him. He hugs him]

KRAMER: Oh, thank you, FDR! Alright, now we’re even.

[At Monk's Cafe]

[On the screen. One Hour Earlier]

[Kramer and FDR are both holding a wishbone]

KRAMER: Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish, I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one hundred percent anti drop dead protection forever.

FDR: Alright.

[They each pull, it breaks. FDR won]

KRAMER: Oh, man! Alright, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.

[FDR lifts up a cooler and puts it on the table]

JERRY: How did he find out?

ELAINE: He schnapped me.

JERRY: You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret!

[Elaine laughs]

JERRY: Is there anything else?

ELAINE: I can't tell you.

JERRY: Here, drink this.

[He hands her a bottle]

ELAINE: Okay.

[She takes a drink and waves Jerry to lean in]

ELAINE: I slept with the groom.

JERRY: Pinter?

ELAINE: He used to be called Peter.

JERRY: So? Who cares about that?

ELAINE: Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.

[Elaine climbs on to the sofa on her knees and head into the side of the couch cushion, her butt in the air towards Jerry]

JERRY: Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on. Up.

ELAINE: Do you know what Jerry is in Indian?

[He carries her out piggy-back style]

JERRY: No, what?

ELAINE: Jugdish.

JERRY: Yes, Jugdish.

ELAINE: Hey, what if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky. Oh!

[She slides off Jerry onto the hallway floor]

JERRY: Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.

[Jerry shuts the door. Elaine peers through the blinds on Jerry's door, sticking her fingers through the blinds and waves at him]

FDR: These things will kill you, but so what.

[He squirts mustard on the hot dog]

FDR: You’re already gonna drop dead

[He grins]

KRAMER: Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night and I wished against your wish.

FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double wished you to drop dead.

[He clicks out some coins from his changer and hands them to Kramer]

FDR: Here's your change.

[Kramer walks over and throws his coins in a nearby fountain]

KRAMER: Alright, I'm triple wishing! Yep!

[FDR throws some coins into the fountain]

FDR: Then I'm quadruple wishing!

KRAMER: Alright. How do you like this?

[He pulls out one of his eyebrows]

KRAMER: Yeah!

[He blows it away]

FDR: I like it a lot.

GEORGE: No. I'm gonna wear black shoes.

[Elaine sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport]

JERRY: This is gonna be great!

SUEELLEN: Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!

ELAINE: You are?

SUEELLEN: Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents and they're Indian.

ELAINE: Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall, we hate each other!

SUEELLEN: Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but I want you to be my maid of honor and my best friend.

ELAINE: Huh. Alright, I guess.

SUEELLEN: Uh, this is my fiancee, Pinter. Say hello.

PINTER: Hello.

ELAINE: Peter?

SUEELLEN: Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?

GEORGE: Oh, no no, we're good. Let's get going. Alright.

[He almost bumps into Jerry]

GEORGE: Watch it, funny man.

[He leaves]

MODEL: Newman, I'm bored.

NEWMAN: Aw.

KRAMER: Does your girlfriend have to be here?

NEWMAN: Does yours?

[Jerry gives Newman a sour look]

ELAINE: Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.

GEORGE: For how long?

NEWMAN: You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.

MODEL: I could listen to you talk about mail all day.

KRAMER: Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes. They're meaningless!

[He laughs evilly, driving away]

KRAMER: Wish?! Newman!

[Kramer runs off after Newman then runs back to the Port-a-potty and bangs on it]

[All the postal workers burst out with laughter]

KRAMER: Well Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.

NEWMAN: Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.

ELAINE: And it's so obvious that they don't want...

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: ...me to go.

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: So, the only reason...

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: ...she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.

JERRY: Uh huh.

NINA: Jerry?

JERRY: Uh, well, you know a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.

ELAINE: Bye bye.

NINA: Bye.

[She leaves]

ELAINE: Who else you got back there?

JERRY: Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.

ELAINE: You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?

JERRY: Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this. It'll crush him.

ELAINE: Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.

JERRY: No good. Too many people know the combination.

ELAINE: What combination?

[Jerry makes the "drinky drinky" sign with his hands]

ELAINE: Don't be ridiculous.

[Jerry opens one of his kitchen drawers]

ELAINE: Oh. Well, Usha.

ZUBIN: I'm Zubin.

ELAINE: Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.

USHA: You're not going to the wedding are you?

ELAINE: Well...

USHA: Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

ZUBIN: You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!

USHA: Here's the registry. Send her a gift and be glad you did not have to go.

ELAINE: Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.

ZUBIN: If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.

ELAINE: That's fantastic.

ZUBIN: And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[On the screen. Thirty Minutes Earlier]

[Jerry and Nina are in the kitchen]

NINA: Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.

JERRY: Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.

NINA: Really?

JERRY: Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.

NINA: I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.

JERRY: I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around.

NINA: Huh, yeah.

JERRY: Probably the reason.

[They both stare at each other, then Jerry clears of the counter with the sweep of his arm. Nina hops onto the counter and they start going at it]


[At FDR's apartment building]

[One the screen. One Day Earlier]

KRAMER: I knew it. Stupid Jerry.


[On the screen. Ten Minutes Earlier]

[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry's at his door talking with Kramer. Kramer's lollipop is slightly bigger]

JERRY: Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.

KRAMER: But you haven't seen...

JERRY: Just go back and ask him again.

[He slams the door on Kramer]

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He heads for FDR's]


[On the screen. Ten Minutes Earlier]

[FDR's apartment. Kramer and FDR are talking at the door. Kramer's lollipop is larger than the scene before]

FDR: That's right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead.

KRAMER: Well, why?

FDR: I have my reasons.

KRAMER: Whoa, wait wait wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.

FDR: That's just a silly superstition.

[He slams his door on Kramer]


[On the screen. Ten Minutes Earlier]

[Kramer comes into Jerry's apartment with a huge lollipop]

KRAMER: Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

GEORGE: FDR?

KRAMER: Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. I go to his birthday part and just before he blew out his candles he gives me this look.

GEORGE: Stink eye?

JERRY: Crook eye?

KRAMER: Evil eye.

JERRY: Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.

GEORGE: Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinking, "These are my friends?!"

JERRY: Everyday is my birthday.

KRAMER: Yeah, well I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.

[Elaine opens the door, hitting Kramer]

ELAINE: Hi.

[Kramer, still wheezing from the door, leaves]

ELAINE: You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.

JERRY: Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.

ELAINE: Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this today.

[She holds up the invitation] 

JERRY: So you think it's a nonvite?

ELAINE: It's an unvitation!

[She notices George is a few inches higher]

ELAINE: Hey, are you getting taller?

GEORGE: Timberlands.

[He showw Elaine his boots]

ELAINE: Ah. Hey, look at this. "Pinter Ranawat". I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat.

JERRY: Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.

GEORGE: Jerry, would you make the call already?

ELAINE: What call?

JERRY: He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.

ELAINE: Oh, the great conversation girl. The one you think can replace me?

[Jerry picks up the phone, dialing Nina]

JERRY: I was kidding when I said that!

GEORGE: Told me the same thing.

JERRY: Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.

GEORGE: You, you sure you never slept with her?

[Jerry shakes his head no]

GEORGE: Perfect.

JERRY: Hey, how about my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?

[George rubs his stomach]

GEORGE: Oh, something's not sitting right.

[George is ordering his meal]

GEORGE: I'll have the Clams Casino.

JERRY: Get out of here.

GEORGE: "Chef recommends".

JERRY: Hmm.

GEORGE: I think she likes me.

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?

JERRY: Are you?

GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?

JERRY: We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.

GEORGE: How engrossing?

JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.

GEORGE: Wow! Heh. You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do you?

[He laughs]

[Jerry snickers, then stares at George, smiling]

JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses. I need an awkward pause.

GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I, I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!

JERRY: So, you're gonna wear them no matter what the situation?

GEORGE: In every situation. No matter how silly I look.

[He tastes his Clams Casino]

GEORGE: Hmm, tastes a little funky.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

[Kramer runs into Monk's with a snowball]

KRAMER: Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packing tight!

[He puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it]

JERRY: What are you bringing snowballs in here for?

KRAMER: Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard and when you throw it, Pop! Oh look.

[FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monk’s]

KRAMER: Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.

JERRY: Oh.

KRAMER: Uh, you need any help or...

JERRY: No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?

KRAMER: Ah, no no no. I, I couldn't impose.

JERRY: Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours.

[And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life]

KRAMER: Oh.

[He eyes Jerry's empty apartment]

KRAMER: Really?
