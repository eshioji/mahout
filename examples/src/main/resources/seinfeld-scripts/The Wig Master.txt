[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I really like the wig historically. I guess the revolutionary war, the last war fought in wig, and it seems that it must have been hard. You know they're going into battle they think, "Well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins?" And you got to make sure you have everything. Lot more to worry about, "What if I get killed? Is my wig on straight?" I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men but I know when it went out! When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair on his head going, "Alright! Let’s go rap to the ladies."


[At the Andover shop]

JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer

CRAIG: A crested blazer.

JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.

CRAIG: Yes, I think we may have something.

[He picks up a blazer]

CRAIG: The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest. That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.

JERRY: Hmm, they'll match my sneakers.

CRAIG: It looks fabulous on you. Shall I wrap it up?

JERRY: You know, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.

CRAIG: A huh.

JERRY: Really, I'll be back.

CRAIG: Yeah.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and Jerry are talking]

JERRY: So I didn't like the crest all that much but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought. And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.

ELAINE: Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.

JERRY: Yeah, he caught me. So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.

ELAINE: That's ridiculous. Why do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?

JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.

ELAINE: But you were!!

JERRY: But if you go back with me then I'm not.

GEORGE: Alright fine, whatever

[Kramer walks in]

JERRY: Problems with the house guest?

ELAINE: What house guest?

GEORGE: This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks. Now am I wrong or is that excessive?

KRAMER: Well Bob Sacamano, he stayed with me once for a year and a half.

ELAINE: Who is he?

GEORGE: He's a wig master

ELAINE: What is a wig master?

GEORGE: He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.

JERRY: Boy, imagine, liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.

KRAMER: About some tickets George, you know I'd kill for a peek.

GEORGE: Yeah, sure, sure. I got to drop my car off at the new lot.

KRAMER: Uh what, what lot is that?

GEORGE: Jiffy Park. It's incredible. Seventy-five dollars a month.

KRAMER: Seventy-five bucks a month!

GEORGE: Yeah and you get this really cool t-shirt when you sign on.

KRAMER: Oh, I'm down.


[At the Andover shop]

JERRY: Remember me? I said I'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?

CRAIG: No, I believed you.

JERRY: Yeah. Well Elaine.

[Elaine looks up to the salesman]

CRAIG: Oh! Hello, I'm Craig.

ELAINE: Hi.

CRAIG: Well.

[He picks up the blazer again]

CRAIG: Here it is.

ELAINE: Oh! Joseph Aboud. And look at this hand ticking around the crest.

CRAIG: You know your coats?

ELAINE: Well I'm in the biz. I work for J. Peterman.

CRAIG: I love J. Peterman.

ELAINE: Oh!

CRAIG: I especially enjoy the catalog, those fanciful narratives really take me away.

ELAINE: Oh! Really, well you know what, I write those.

CRAIG: No!

ELAINE: Yeah!

JERRY: Hey Elaine What about the crest? What do you think of the crest here?

ELAINE: Well I love it.

JERRY: You what?

ELAINE: I think it's great. I think you should get it.

CRAIG: Well, will it be check or credit card?

JERRY: Check.

CRAIG: I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me.

[He turns to Elaine]

CRAIG: Perhaps you could do the same.

[Elaine laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl]


[On the street where Jerry and Elaine are walking]

JERRY: You weren't supposed to say that.

ELAINE: But I really did like it

JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.

ELAINE: Uh, sorry!

JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?

ELAINE: What is the big deal!?

JERRY: It's very emasculating. He doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes. That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!

ELAINE: He dared.


[At George's apartment as he comes in]

[Ethan is sitting on the couch and combing his wigs]

ETHAN: Hi George. How was your day?

GEORGE: Good, good day. You?

ETHAN: I am getting so much work done. See?

GEORGE: Very nice

SUSAN: Hi sweetie. How was your day?

ETHAN: I already ask him that. He said, "Good, good day."

[George scratches his head]


[In Jerry and Kramer's hallway]

KRAMER: Thank God you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?

JERRY: No, I gave it back to you

KRAMER: You did? Look, um, can you take me over there?

JERRY: Oh come on!!

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue.

JERRY: I didn't tell you to park in that lot. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car? Take the bus!

KRAMER: I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!

JERRY: Forget it.

KRAMER: Alright, I'm gonna get George to pick me up.

JERRY: He won’t take you.

[Kramer picks up the phone and calls George. George is sitting between Susan and the wig master on the couch. The phone rings]

GEORGE: Got it, Got it, hello?

KRAMER: Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah!! I'll pick you up right now. Alright, alright. Hey! Gotta go.


[In George's car. Kramer repeatedly changes the station on the radio]

GEORGE: So the Wig master, the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight and he'll show you around. Would you pick a station!!!

KRAMER: I like them all.

[He still fiddles with the radio]

GEORGE: Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off

[Kramer fishes around on the floor looking for the volume knob]

KRAMER: What's this? God!!

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: That's a, a condom!!

[They both shriek]


[At Monk's Cafe]

ELAINE: How do you like working there at the um, Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.

CRAIG: Hmm.

ELAINE: Except for Jerry!

CRAIG: So did you see anything you'd like?

ELAINE: Oh!

CRAIG: Because I can get you a considerable discount.

ELAINE: Really? Well actually yeah I did see this amazing little black dress. It was sleeveless...

CRAIG: The Nicole Miller

ELAINE: Yeah yeah.

CRAIG: I'll take care of it.

ELAINE: Really? But I barely know you.

CRAIG: Well um, we'll just have to do something about that. Won't we?

ELAINE: Ah! Ah! Ah!

[Jerry peeks into Monks window then comes in as Craig is leaving]

JERRY: Hey! Greg.

CRAIG: It's Craig.

JERRY: Ah! Right. Nice. Lunch with Elaine?

CRAIG: Yes lovely.

JERRY: You know I'm just curious, how did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?

CRAIG: Well, I could just sense it.

JERRY: Because you know we used to go out.

CRAIG: Oh, you did?

JERRY: Oh yeah, we went way out and wild.

ELAINE: Hey Jer?

JERRY: Hi Elaine.

[A lady selling roses comes in]

ROSELADY: Would you like to buy a rose for your wife?

[Craig and Elaine both laugh]

JERRY: How do you know she's not my wife?


[At Jiffy Park]

GEORGE: I want to know how did that get into my car?

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Hey look, you walk in to this city you got to expect things are gonna stick to your foot. You open in your car and bing!! Condom.

GEORGE: That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Here take a few shirts.

[A man walks over to the attendant and whispers into his ear]

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: I'm terribly sorry Mr. Kramer but we can't get your car now, the keys seem to have been misplaced.

KRAMER: Wait a minute I need those keys. I won't be able to get into my apartment.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Mr. Kramer, you like Cadillac’s?

KRAMER: Yeah, I like Cadillac’s. Why? What you got on your mind?

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Take that pink Eldorado Cadillac over there, it's a Mary Kay car.

KRAMER: Mary Kay huh?

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Mary Kay car.

KRAMER: Well listen, see you later. Thanks for driving me by.

[Two prostitutes walk up to a car]

HOOKER: Hey!! What’s happening?

GEORGE: We're gonna hang around here a little while. Something funny going on here.


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: You were wrong about Craig. He's a very sweet guy.

JERRY: Well, what about the ponytail?

ELAINE: What about it?

JERRY: Come on, Ponytail? Get real.

ELAINE: All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.

JERRY: Of course he did. The guy's working you.

ELAINE: Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.

JERRY: Have you slept with him yet?

ELAINE: I just met him this morning.

JERRY: It's been known to happen. I'm telling you right now Elaine, this guy's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.

ELAINE: Well this is all very flattering.

JERRY: Like a shark fisherman with a bucket of...

ELAINE: Okay.

JERRY: Like a shrimp farmer...

ELAINE: Okay!!


[At the Majestic theater]

ETHAN: Well that's the grand tour. Aw, but I save the best for last.

[Ethan shows him a very wild and colorful full length coat]

KRAMER: Oh yeah!!

ETHAN: Behold. The Technicolor Dreamcoat.

KRAMER: Oh pops, wow!! Spectacular.


[At the Jiffy Park]

GEORGE: Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

HOOKER: Are you a cop??

GEORGE: Oh no, no no no I'm not a cop. I work for the Yankees.

HOOKER: Ugh, they stink.

GEORGE: Nevertheless, I was wondering if you and your friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park. You know, um, what do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway, I, I found a condom in my car and I'm not saying it's yours but I want to know if I should just change parking lots.

HOOKER: Get lost mister, I'm trying to make a living here.

GEORGE: I'll pay you for your time. I just, I just need some information. How much do you want? Ten, fifteen? You have change for twenty?

HOOKER: Fifteen?

[Susan approaches]

SUSAN: George?

GEORGE: Hi honey.

[The hooker picks up the money as George looks embarrassed]


[At George's apartment]

SUSAN: So you're telling me the truth?

GEORGE: Of course I'm telling the truth.

SUSAN: Because I have to be able to trust you. If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.

GEORGE: Really?

SUSAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Well then, then you really have something to think about because you know if there's any doubt in your mind and, and it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a dot of a doubt and...

SUSAN: There's no doubt.

GEORGE: Because if there's any doubt at all I, I feel we should cultivate it.

SUSAN: Cultivate it?

GEORGE: Yes, you know. Deal with it. We have to deal with the doubt Susan, The doubt!! Must be dealt with.

SUSAN: I have no doubt George. Do you?

[George hesitates]

GEORGE: No.


[Elaine and Craig are walking on the street]

ELAINE: You know I can't wait to get that dress.

CRAIG: Yeah, It should arrive eminently.

ELAINE: Arrive?

CRAIG: Yes! From Milan.

ELAINE: But you said it was in the store!

CRAIG: No no no, we sold out and had to order some more.

ELAINE: But I thought Nicole Miller was made...

CRAIG: Ian!!

IAN: Hey Craig.

CRAIG: Elaine this is Ian.

ELAINE: Hi Ian.

IAN: Ian.

ELAINE: Ian.

CRAIG: Ian, he's a friend a mine from England.

IAN: What are doing?

CRAIG: I'm working at the Andover shop actually. You should come by. I'll get you a great discount.

IAN: Maybe I will. Nice meeting you.

ELAINE: Oh, nice to meet you.

CRAIG: Bye.

IAN: Cheery oh.

ELAINE: Bye Ian.

ELAINE: So you're giving him a discount too?

CRAIG: Hmm, why so surprised?

ELAINE: No reason.


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are watching TV]

JERRY: You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back. I'm putting this guy right out of commission!

KRAMER: I'm gonna turn in.

JERRY: Turn in?

KRAMER: Yeah, I had a tough day

JERRY: It's only nine o'clock.

KRAMER: Well I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.

JERRY: I can't go to sleep at nine o'clock!

KRAMER: Well you can go to your room and read.

JERRY: Hey look, you know you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.

KRAMER: But I'm tired.

JERRY: Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's?

KRAMER: Ah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin. I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.

JERRY: Well that's all I got.

KRAMER: Can I sleep with you?

JERRY: Huh?

KRAMER: Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.

JERRY: Kramer, there's no way you're sleeping with me.

KRAMER: Why?

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: Do I really have to explain why?

KRAMER: Well I...

[Elaine pops in at that moment]

ELAINE: Hi!

KRAMER: Hi. What's that?

ELAINE: Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalog.

KRAMER: Wow.

ELAINE: You want it?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: You can have, I don't need it anymore.

KRAMER: Oh mama.

[He walks with the cane]

ELAINE: Okay, so I am positive you are wrong about Craig.

JERRY: Yeah, why?

ELAINE: Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too. A man Jerry.

JERRY: So, who is he?

ELAINE: Some friend of his from England.

JERRY: Don't you see? It's all a big scam.

ELAINE: You're nuts!

KRAMER: How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?

ELAINE: What do you mean?

KRAMER: What do I mean? Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings. And then when you get it, you know, you drop him like a hot potato.

ELAINE: Aw please.

KRAMER: Now see the two of you need to work on trust and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship. And now if you would excuse us.

[He taps twice on the door with the cane]

KRAMER: We need to get to bed.


[In Jerry's bed. The lights are out. Kramer turns on the light and starts to read]

KRAMER: Hmm, patio furniture's on sale.


[At Jiffy Park the next morning]

GEORGE: Excuse me uh, I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: What's the problem?

GEORGE: You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: That is all hearsay.

GEORGE: Alright, very good, I'd like my car and my deposit back please.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Can't do it.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable.

GEORGE: Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? Because I don't remember reading that clause either.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs.

GEORGE: Alright, just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Well that's going to be a problem.

GEORGE: Why?

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days.

GEORGE: What are you talking about? I want my car!!

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: We ask that you please bear with us.

GEORGE: Bear with you!? This is a parking lot, people are supposed to be able to get their cars!!

JIFFYPARKATTENDANT: Ideally.


[At the Andover shop]

JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: Certainly. May I ask why?

JERRY: For spite.

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: Spite?

JERRY: That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: I don't think you can return an item for spite.

JERRY: What do you mean?

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund.

JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is?

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: Let me speak with the manager. Excuse me, Bob?

[She walks over to the manager and whispers]

ANDOVERSALESWOMAN: ...spite...

[The manager walks over]

ANDOVERMANAGER: What seems to be the problem?

JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.

ANDOVERMANAGER: That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.

JERRY: Well, so fine then. Then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it.

ANDOVERMANAGER: Well you already said spite so...

JERRY: But I changed my mind.

ANDOVERMANAGER: No, you said spite. Too late.


[On a terrace where Kramer is sitting with Ethan and a woman]

[They make fun of a woman walking by]

KRAMER: It's Halloween.

CHARMAINE: Get a calendar honey! It's the nineties.

KRAMER: Hey! Elaine.

JERRY: Oh! Hey!

KRAMER: These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.

JERRY: Hi!

ELAINE: Hi! How are you doing?

CHARMAINE: Hi. I'm Charmaine.

ETHAN: I'm Ethan.

KRAMER: Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.

JERRY: Hey, you're staying with my friend George.

ETHAN: Right George! I get the feeling he doesn't want me there.

JERRY: Well he doesn't even want himself there.

[They all laugh]

CHARMAINE: Why don't you sit down and join us?

JERRY: Alright.

ELAINE: I can't, I've got to meet a friend.

KRAMER: Well what are we, dog meat?

ETHAN: Champagne Coolies, please.

ETHAN: You've got really beautiful hair.

ELAINE: Oh Thanks, thank you very much.

ETHAN: Have you ever thought about selling it? It would make a brilliant wig.

JERRY: They make wigs out of human hairs?

ETHAN: And pay plenty for them.

ELAINE: Well you guys are gonna have fun here so bye, take care.

KRAMER: Yeah. See you later.

CHARMAINE: Oh! I just remembered, I've got to get the Dreamcoat from the dry cleaners.

KRAMER: Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?

CHARMAINE: Yeah. But your gonna have to be really careful with it, it's my only backup.

KRAMER: Hey! Who do you think you're talking to?

CHARMAINE: Okay. Bye bye!

KRAMER: Bye!!

JERRY: Bye!

[They both leave. Jerry and Ethan are alone]

ETHAN: There's your Champagne Coolie. Well looks like it's just you and me cowboy!

JERRY: Guess so.


[At Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: Well, here we are.

CRAIG: I am beat. Oh, that's nice.

ELAINE: So um, so do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?

CRAIG: Oh! Yeah, the Nicole Millers, um, well the funniest thing.

ELAINE: Huh!

CRAIG: I've learned that the new shipment's coming in by boat which does tend to take a little longer with, you know, what with the waves and all. So you'll just have to be a little bit patient.

ELAINE: Hmm, so you've no idea when they'll arrive?

CRAIG: No, I really don't.


[Back to the terrace with Jerry and Ethan]

ETHAN: How can she go with a guy like that? He's a mess. I just don't see them together at all

[A man approaches]

JESSIE: Ethan?

ETHAN: Yes?

JESSIE: Hi it's me, Jessie. George Hamilton's personal assistant?

ETHAN: Right, right.

[They both greet each other]

ETHAN: How you doing?

JESSIE: Nice to see you.

ETHAN: This is Jerry.

JERRY: Hello.

JESSIE: Yeah, um Ethan, what brings you in to town?

ETHAN: I'm touring with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

JESSIE: You're kidding. Listen, maybe you and I should um, get together. Have you been on the slide at Club USA? It's intense.

JERRY: Excuse me, excuse me. Are you asking him out?

JESSIE: Yeah, I guess you could say that.

JERRY: Right in front of me? How do you know we're not together? Two guys sitting, laughing, drinking Champagne Coolies.

JESSIE: I don't know, I just didn't think you were.

JERRY: Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that?

JESSIE: I don’t know. I just didn't.

JERRY: Well it's very emasculating.

[Jessie looks befuddled and leaves]


[At Elaine's apartment. The phone rings]

ELAINE: Hello?

ANDOVERMANAGER: Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.

ELAINE: Um huh! Is it important?

ANDOVERMANAGER: Well...

ELAINE: Let me ask you something. Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?

ANDOVERMANAGER: Nicole Millers? We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.

ELAINE: Well do you have any in a size four?

ANDOVERMANAGER: Yes, several. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before eleven.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I'll make sure he gets the message.

[She looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks, "They make wigs out of human hair?" Ethan's voice, "And pay plenty for them."]


[A woman in a white coat and hat leaves a store. Her hat gets caught in a gust of wind and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with the walking stick and puts it on. He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat, hat, and stick looking very much like a stereotypical pimp. He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac]

KRAMER: Oh, sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.

[Out of the car comes the hooker with a client]

KRAMER: Hey, what are you doing in my car? Hey! Hey! Hey! Where you going?

HOOKER: Hey. You just cost me some money mister!

[She starts hitting Kramer]

KRAMER: Cool it lady!

[They struggle and we hear a siren]

[A police officer's voice is heard, "Police officer. Freeze right there."]


[As the credits roll Kramer is getting his booking photo at the police station]

[A police officer's voice is heard, "Okay, big daddy. Take the hat off. Alright, turn to your right."]

[Kramer hesitates]

[A police officer's voice is heard, "I said turn pimp!!"]

KRAMER: I'm not a pimp!!
