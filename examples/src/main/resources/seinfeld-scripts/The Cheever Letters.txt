[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags]

JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?

GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.

JERRY: "We're?" What do you mean, "we're?"

GEORGE: Susan wants me to be there.

JERRY: You're meeting the father for the first time?

GEORGE: Yeah.

[Jerry chuckles slightly]

JERRY: Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.

GEORGE: I didn't burn it down, Kramer did!

[Jerry laughs]

JERRY: I mean the whole thing is ironic. Think of it. Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars....

GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.

JERRY: No, but wait, wait. And then you dump them off onto Kramer...

GEORGE: I know.

JERRY: ...who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! It's very comical.

GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.

JERRY: No no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.

GEORGE: I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what, what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down.

JERRY: Come on. It's not even a house. It's like a cabin.

GEORGE: We could build a cabin like that.

[He snaps his fingers]

JERRY: Well, maybe not us, but two men could.

GEORGE: Bics? What did you get Bics?

JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?

GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.

JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work.

[They both move into the living room ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down]

JERRY: NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act One, Scene A.

GEORGE: So, you're gonna sit there?

JERRY: Just, just park yourself.

[George reluctantly sits on the sofa]

JERRY: Alright. Act One, Scene A.

GEORGE: Drink?

JERRY: No, no thank you.

GEORGE: Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Act One, Scene A.

[A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes]

GEORGE: Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?

[Jerry eagerly reaches for the phone]

JERRY: Yes.

[George turns the TV on and begins watching as Jerry dials the number]

JERRY: Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, hi Sandra. Uh yeah, I can hold. Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for like, twenty minutes. Oh, hi Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. I'll be off in a minute! Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks!

[He turns to George]

JERRY: Are you thinking of ideas?

[George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry]

JERRY: Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for like, twenty minutes. So we're on for later?

[Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand]

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happening here.

[Sandra passes her doorway]

ELAINE: Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.

[She hangs up]

ELAINE: Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?


[Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Okay, let's go.

[George shuts the television off, ready to work]

GEORGE: Alright, here we go. You got it?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: Okay, how about this. I'm in my apartment, you come in.

[George holds out his arms, giving praise]

GEORGE: It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?

[A long pause]


[Back to Elaine and Sandra]

ELAINE: Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?

SANDRA: Why? Did Jerry say something?

ELAINE: No no.

SANDRA: He must have said something.

ELAINE: Oh no, he didn't say anything.

[Sandra is near tears]

SANDRA: I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving.

[She leaves]

ELAINE: No Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut waking both of them up]

GEORGE: Alright, let's go.

JERRY: Here we go.

[Both get situated to write as Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Yeah Kramer, we're uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work.

JERRY: Yeah, come on.

[Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh]

JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: No more golf.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah well, I lost them all in the fire!

[He leans over the couch and addresses George]

KRAMER: Hey George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?

GEORGE: What are you, crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!

KRAMER: Why? What's one thing got to do with another?

GEORGE: Kramer please.

KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.

KRAMER: Where? They're Cubans.

[He leaves]

GEORGE: You know what? Maybe I should take off.

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner and, you know, I want to shower first and I want to leave myself plenty of time.

[Jerry looks at his watch]

JERRY: You got four hours! What about the script?

GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it.

[He leaves]


[At the Ross's house]

[Susan, her parents, and George are all dining]

MRSROSS: Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?

MRROSS: A slight resemblance.

[George laughs slightly]

MRSROSS: Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

GEORGE: Oh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean to dedicate yourself to the foot you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean...

[Seeing the Ross's expression, he trails off]

MRROSS: How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?

GEORGE: Oh uh, the cigars.

[He chuckles nervously]

GEORGE: I'm uh, sucking them down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

MRROSS: You know those cigars are made special for Castro?

GEORGE: I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.

[Susan and George both laugh]

MRROSS: What?

SUSAN: He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.

MRROSS: I didn't care much for his jokes.

SUSAN: Daddy never laughs.

GEORGE: Oh well, so what? Laughter, what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha ha!"? What is that? "Ha ha!"

MRROSS: You know you can't get those cigars anywhere.

MRSROSS: You and your cigars.

MRROSS: Wear some more lipstick.

SUSAN: Daddy, there's um, there's something that we have to talk to you about.

MRROSS: Oh, I forgot to ask you, how'd you like the cabin?

GEORGE: Oh, the uh, the cabin... well...


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and Elaine are talking. Jerry's using a harsh tone]

JERRY: Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!

ELAINE: I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?

JERRY: Oh, dial the number.

[Elaine picks up the phone and starts to dial]

JERRY: How could you do this?

[She hand the phone to Jerry]

ELAINE: I was just trying to help you.

JERRY: Oh, just trying to...

[He rudely grabs the phone from her]

JERRY: ...help me. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

[Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn grabbing a fistful]

JERRY: Listen, I, I just want to tell you...

[Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand, forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child]

JERRY: ...there's been a terrible misunderstanding. See, I told Elaine that uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, because I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant, "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." You know, but I was really being sincere. No, of course I like you. Tonight? Um, uh, hold on a second.

[He whispers to Elaine]

JERRY: Now she wants to have a drink with me.

[Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry gives in again. Back on the phone]

JERRY: Yeah, I think I can. Um... yeah, I know where that is. Okay. Uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye.

[He hangs up, peeved]

JERRY: Now I gotta have a drink with her.


[At the Ross's house]

[Same diner party is going on. News of the cabin has yet to be discussed]

GEORGE: The cabin...

[He laughs nervously]

GEORGE: Well...

[He pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news and then decides to pass it off] 
GEORGE: Susan?

SUSAN: Uh... about the cabin...

MRROSS: I love that place. My father built that cabin in nineteen forty-seven. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away ten years later to the day. His last words to me were...

[Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times, she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them]

MRROSS: "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin."

[He smiles, reflecting]

MRROSS: And I have for forty-five years. It's often been a sanctuary for me.

GEORGE: Kind of like Superman's fortress of solitude.

MRROSS: What?

GEORGE: Uh, Superman. He uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole to uh, you know, sort of get away from it all.

MRROSS: When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

[He points at Susan]

MRSROSS: I'll take a hotel any day.

SUSAN: Daddy?

MRROSS: Yes?

SUSAN: Daddy, about the cabin.

[Mrs. Ross laughs]

MRSROSS: Look Henry, I spilled wine on me!

[She laughs again]

MRROSS: What about it?

SUSAN: Well, the thing is...

MRROSS: What? What is it?

SUSAN: Well, the, the cabin is, kind of, uh... George?

GEORGE: Burned.

MRROSS: Burned?

SUSAN: There was a fire and it uh...

GEORGE: Burned.

MRROSS: The cabin burned?

GEORGE: Yeah, burned. Whoa...

[Mrs. Ross laughs]

MRSROSS: Burned!

[George laughs with her]

MRROSS: Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?

SUSAN: No. Nothing.

[Mrs. Ross laughs, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune]

MRSROSS: Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.

[Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk]

GEORGE: Uh, but you know, Mr. Ross, if, if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars and everything, it's really rather ironic. One might even say, in a sense, comical.

[Mr. Ross has by now left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing as if to say he hit the bull’s-eye. George calls out to Mr. Ross]

GEORGE: Really. Think about it.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Sandra runs out of Jerry's room, hastily putting on her jacket. Jerry follows, buttoning his shirt]

SANDRA: I can't believe you said that!

JERRY: What?!

SANDRA: How could you say something like that to me?!

JERRY: What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!

SANDRA: That was a weird thing to say.

JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

SANDRA: Oh, I think you're really sick.

JERRY: I'm not sick.

[He points at her]

JERRY: You, you said much sicker things than me.

SANDRA: I'm leaving.

[She moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path]

JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.

SANDRA: Excuse me.

[They both move to the door]

JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.

SANDRA: That's okay.

JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us and that'll be the end of it.

SANDRA: Oh, really?

[She walks out]

JERRY: I mean, people, they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Jerry's telling George about last night]

JERRY: So we're uh, drinking and talking and uh, so she starts rubbing my leg.

GEORGE: Whoa! What did you do?

JERRY: Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"

GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?

JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.

GEORGE: Alright, so go ahead.

JERRY: So we go back to my apartment.

GEORGE: Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY: So we're uh, fooling around there you know, it's getting a little passionate... 

[He scoots closer to George to prevent others from hearing]

JERRY: ...and uh, she starts with the dirty talking.

[George puts his hands up]

GEORGE: Alright, alright, hold on! Time out! Whoa, whoa!

[He scoots in, giddy]

GEORGE: What did she say?

JERRY: Oh you know, the usual.

GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?

JERRY: Typical things.

[George picks up the ketchup]

GEORGE: What typical? Give me typical. Give me some typical.

JERRY: She says, uh...

[He mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle. Ketchup squirts out and flies off screen. George reacts deeply]

GEORGE: That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.

JERRY: And then she starts talking about her panties.

[George yells out to a waitress]

GEORGE: Gonna need some water here!

JERRY: So I said something.

GEORGE: Okay, what did you say?

JERRY: Now bear in mind I am just trying to keep up.

GEORGE: Of course.

JERRY: Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so uh, so I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"

[George takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it]

GEORGE: "The panties your mother laid out for you"? What does that mean?

[Jerry throws up his hands] 

JERRY: I don't know! It just popped out.

GEORGE: Well, how did she react?

JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.

GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.

GEORGE: Well, what if this girl says something?

JERRY: She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it, how stupid was that? Hey, so Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.

JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.

GEORGE: Huh. Come on, let's go. We got a lot of work to do today.

JERRY: Alright, big work day.

GEORGE: That's right.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and George, with their writing materials, go to sit down in the living room while giving each other pep talks]

GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Let's go.

GEORGE: Here we are.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Let's do it.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: What do you got?

JERRY: I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go "Hello." Now we need something here.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Oh hey.

[Both George and Jerry get up, giving Kramer an excited greeting, talking fast, together]

KRAMER: Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back.

[He turns to leave. Jerry and George strongly protest with a series of "No, no, no!"] 
KRAMER: No, you guys should get back to work.

[More protests]

GEORGE: Don't be silly.

JERRY: Come in, we're taking a break.

[Kramer moves back into the room]

KRAMER: Oh yeah?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Uh George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?

GEORGE: No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.

KRAMER: Okay well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? Alright, I'll see you guys.

[He leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George]


[At the United Nations Permanent Mission of Cuba building]

[Kramer walks up to a secretary]

KRAMER: Buenos dias.

CUBANSECRETARY: Buenos dias.

KRAMER: Uh, habla ingles?

CUBANSECRETARY: Si.

KRAMER: Giddy up. Okay, uh...

[He looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly]

KRAMER: Um, I need to talk to someone.

CUBANSECRETARY: What is this about?

KRAMER: Uh well, it’s a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.

CUBANSECRETARY: Are you an American?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.

CUBANSECRETARY: I see, excuse me.

[She picks up the phone]

KRAMER: Okay.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry is curled up on his living room chair and George is laid out on the sofa asleep. Jerry's buzzer goes off waking them up. George rolls off the couch and falls to the floor]

JERRY: Alright, let's get going. Come on, come on now. Come on, let's get it together. Yeah?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while.

JERRY: Yeah we should.

GEORGE: Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross's apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?

JERRY: Yeah. What, what, does she live with them?

GEORGE: No no no no.

JERRY: Oh.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey, nice going Jerome Seinfeld!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.

JERRY: Well, then you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it, there's no two ways about it.

ELAINE: Why? What happened? Did you talk?

JERRY: Talk? Did I talk? You're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Really? You really think I should fire her?

JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script I'd do it myself.

[George, sitting out the couch, dozes off to sleep]


[At United Nations Permanent Mission of Cuba building]

[A group of men in suits walk out into the lobby to deal with Kramer]

[A Cuban man speaks some Spanish to the secretary]

[Kramer stands up and greets the men]

KRAMER: Buenos dias.

LOUIS: What is your name, Senior?

KRAMER: Uh, Kramer.

LOUIS: So, Senior Kramer, what is this about?

[Kramer leans in, confidentially]

KRAMER: Cigars.

LOUIS: Cigars?

KRAMER: Cigars.

LOUIS: What about cigars?

KRAMER: Uh, see here, I...

[He pulls out a paper ring from his pocket]

KRAMER: ...I saved one of the cigar rings.

LOUIS: Oh.

[He laughs and pulls a cigar from his inner coat pocket]

LOUIS: You mean one of these?

[Kramer points at the cigar, incredibly nervous]

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. That, that's uh, okay. So uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?

[Louis deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma]

LOUIS: You do realize of course these are illegal in your country.

KRAMER: Um, what? Oh, illegal, huh?

[The man is staring at Kramer's clothes, mesmerized. He reaches out to touch Kramer's legendary jacket]

LOUIS: I like that jacket.


[At the Ross's home]

[There's a knock at the door. Susan answers it, it's Jerry and George]

SUSAN: Hi!

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

[They kiss]

SUSAN: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.

SUSAN: I thought you two guys were working today.

JERRY: Ah, just taking a little break.

GEORGE: Yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses.

[He hands them to her]

SUSAN: Okay, thanks. Come on in for a second.

[They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper]

SUSAN: This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.

GEORGE: Oh, hey there young fellow.

[They shake hands]

GEORGE: What's your major?

RICKY: I don't have one.

GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry.

[He pats Ricky on the shoulder] 
GEORGE: There's nothing wrong with the feet.

[Ricky looks critically back at George]

SUSAN: And this is my Aunt Sara.

SARA: He doesn't look like me.

MRSROSS: Sara, what do you have on your wheels?

SARA: Nothing, they're clean.

MRSROSS: Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

RICKY: Yes.

MRSROSS: Well they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy. 
[She wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug]

MRSROSS: When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.

[The doorbell rings]

SUSAN: Excuse me.

[She answers the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box]

SUSAN: Hello Raymond.

RAYMOND: Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.

SUSAN: Oh, thank you.

[As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George]

SUSAN: Wow, I've never seen this before.

[She opens the charred box]

SUSAN: Oh, they're letters.

[She hands the box to George]

SUSAN: Here.

GEORGE: Oh sure.

[He holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters]

SUSAN: From...

[Trying to read one]

SUSAN: From John Cheever.

JERRY: Oh, wow.

GEORGE: Oh, wow.

SUSAN: "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my... orgasm...

[She now has everyone's attention]

SUSAN: ...has left me a cripple. I don't how I shall ever get back to work."

[Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes]

SUSAN: "I love you madly, John."

[Pause]

SUSAN: "P.S., loved the cabin."

[George nods and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction]

[A long pause]

GEORGE: Well, we... we, we ah...

[Jerry looks at his watch]

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: We really should be uh, heading out.

JERRY: Yeah.

[He taps his watch]

JERRY: Look at the time.

GEORGE: You know, the time.

[Susan's father is now standing in the hallway]

MRROSS: The box!

[He rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands]

MRROSS: My letters! Give me that!

[He holds them against his chest, defensively]

MRROSS: Who told you to open this?!

MRSROSS: Who's John?! Who's John?!

SARA: I knew it!

MRSROSS: I want to know who John is!

RICKY: John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!

MRROSS: Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I loved him deeply! In a way you could never understand.

[He slowly walks back to his room leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go]

GEORGE: Well, we really should be..

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.

JERRY: Yeah, and...

[He points to his watch]

JERRY: ...because of the...

[They slowly exit]

JERRY: ...time.

GEORGE: Yeah, time is what he's indicating there.

JERRY: We'll see you.

GEORGE: Uh, anyway, onward and upward.

[Jerry grabs George and leaves]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and George once again are sitting down in the living room attempting to write]

GEORGE: Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Alright, let's go.

GEORGE: Come on now.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: You got it.

JERRY: No fooling.

GEORGE: Okay, so, what do you got?

JERRY: Alright, I got uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".

GEORGE: Alright, so we need something.

JERRY: Yeah. How about this. I say, "How's it going?"

GEORGE: "How's it going?" Beautiful.

[They both start to write it down as a pounding on the door sounds]

GEORGE: Oh come on, we were just on a roll now.

JERRY: Alright, did you get that line?

GEORGE: "How's it going?"

JERRY: Did you write it down?

GEORGE: I'm writing it. "How's it going?"

JERRY: Okay.

[He opens the door to a frantic Elaine]

ELAINE: Real good!

JERRY: What?!

ELAINE: Do you know how much money you cost me today?! Four hundred and twenty-nine dollars!

JERRY: What?! How?

ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!

JERRY: What calls?!

ELAINE: Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch and Sandra told Lippman!

JERRY: Oh, did she say anything else to you?

ELAINE: "Anything else?" What do you mean "anything else?"

JERRY: So she just left the office, didn't say a word to you about anything?

ELAINE: Yeah!

JERRY: Beautiful.

ELAINE: Why is that beautiful?

JERRY: Oh no, not beautiful.

ELAINE: Its four hundred and twenty-nine dollars!

JERRY: Hey look, I'm going to pay for that.

ELAINE: No no.

[He takes out his checkbook] 

JERRY: No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her, the whole thing was all my...

ELAINE: Okay.

[He pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept]

JERRY: ...fault.

[He starts to write a check out then stops, looking at the door]

JERRY: Do you smell smoke?

[Elaine opens the door to find Kramer and the 3 Cubans dressed up in golf wear, smoking cigars]

KRAMER: Oh hey! Hey Jer, I want you to meet my new friends here. This is uh, Louis, Jorge and Umberto.

JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.

KRAMER: Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester, gonna hit the links.

JERRY: Oh.

[He notices Louis's jacket]

JERRY: Isn't that uh, your...

[Kramer tryies to avoid the issue]

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, okay, we're going. Vamoose muchachos!

[They exit]

ELAINE: Hey, what are you reading?

GEORGE: Oh uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.

ELAINE: John Cheever? You ever read any of his stuff?

JERRY: Uh yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing.

[George shoots Jerry a smirk then returns to his book]

JERRY: Alright.

[He hands the check to Elaine]

JERRY: Look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.

ELAINE: Okay, I'll leave you two alone.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties...

[Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair]

ELAINE: ...and they're all laid out for me.

[she leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places]
