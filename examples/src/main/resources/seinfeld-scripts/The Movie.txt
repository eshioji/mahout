[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Did you ever notice they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen... and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips it, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, your selling the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.


[A night at the Improv. Jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager. The show has been delayed]

JERRY: I don't understand, the show's delayed? Why?

KERNIS: I don't know. Guy told me to hold it for fifteen minutes.

JERRY: You don't understand, I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at nine fifty, I'm not gonna be able to make it!

KERNIS: I hear you guy.

JERRY: And I'm doing Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!

KERNIS: Let me see what I can do.

[Jerry sees another comedian, Buckles]

JERRY: Oh no, buckles? Your not going to put him on tonight are you?

KERNIS: No. He hangs around in case somebody drops out. Look, why don't you come back and do the eleven o'clock spot?

JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie "Checkmate" at ten thirty.

[He thinks about it]

JERRY: Alright, forget the movie, I'll do the eleven o'clock spot. I'll be back.

[Jerry goes to leave]

BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!

JERRY: Hey...

[Jerry doesn't lose a step and walks out the door]


[At the Paragon Theater. George joins the end of a line. He taps the shoulder of the man in front of him]

GEORGE: Excuse me, do you have a ticket?

MANINMOVIELINE: No.

GEORGE: Okay. Good.


[At another comedy club]

MORY: You missed your spot, it was nine fifteen

JERRY: Mory I'm positive you told me nine fifty.

MORY: In any event, I had no alternative but to reassign your spot to one of your peers who posseses a clearer understanding of our scheduling policy.

[Mory leaves and Buckles comes in]

BUCKLES: Jerry!

JERRY: What are you doing here?

BUCKLES: Hey, do you think this is funny? "Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time and believe me, he's no athlete!"

JERRY: I got to leave.

BUCKLES: Where?

JERRY: Movies.

BUCKLES: I thought you told Kernis you were going back to do the eleven o'clock.

JERRY: I am, I'm just going to stop by the theatre and tell my friends that  can't make it.

BUCKLES: Well that's cool, I'll split a cab with you.

JERRY: I could be a while over there.

BUCKLES: I got time! It will give us a chance to get to know one another a little better.

[Buckles follows Jerry out the door]


[At the Paragon Movie Theatre]

[Elaine joins George in the movie line. She knocks the back of his knee]

ELAINE: Hey.

[She laughs]

ELAINE: Where is everybody?

GEORGE: Everybody's late because they know good old George will get in line early.

ELAINE: Oh, I've been dying to see "Checkmate".

GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as "Ponce de Leon", I'll be happy.

ELAINE: "Ponce de Leon?" Are you kidding me? I hated that movie! 

GEORGE: "Ponce de Leon?" But that was great!

ELAINE: Oh come on. That fountain of youth scene at the end where they're all splashing around and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! That is so stupid!

GEORGE: Let me tell you something. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed and that tear started to roll down his cheek I lost it.

[Kramer joins George and Elaine]

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Where have you been?

KRAMER: Up around the corner at the Paradise Twin

ELAINE: Well I told you the Paragon.

KRAMER: No, you said Paradise. I mean it's playing there too you know.

ELAINE: No, I would never said Paradise, that's a twin theatre. I want to see this movie on a big screen.

[Kramer looks across the street]

KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Papaya King.

ELAINE: No, wait!

GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!

KRAMER: I'm starving, I haven't had any dinner!

ELAINE: Well you can get a hot dog at the theater.

KRAMER: I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! I want a Papaya King hot dog!

ELAINE: Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second and then this line is going to start moving and we're going to end up in the front row.

KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.

[This touches a raw nerve]

ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat saving incident!

KRAMER: Well give me my ticket then.

GEORGE: I don't have them yet.

ELAINE: What do you mean you don't have them yet?

GEORGE: I'm in the line to buy.

ELAINE: No George, this is the ticket holder’s line.

GEORGE: No it's not, it's the ticket buyers line.

ELAINE: Then how come we're not moving?

KRAMER: Good question.

[George addresses the man in front of him]

GEORGE: Is this the ticket holder’s line or the buyers?

[George gloats, knowing what the answer is going to be]

MANINMOVIELINE: Holders.

[Instant double-take]

GEORGE: But I asked you before if you had a ticket and you said no!

MANINMOVIELINE: I didn't. My friend was getting it.

GEORGE: Good. It's good to be accurate like that. Alright, stay here, I'll go get tickets.

ELAINE: Can you believe him?

KRAMER: He's spaced out.

[A shot of the ticket booth with the sign "Sold Out"]

ELAINE: How long would you have stood in the ticket holder’s line?

[Kramer thinks for a while]

ELAINE: Yeah, exactly.

[George returns]

GEORGE: Sold out.

ELAINE: Oh, real good George. Real good.

GEORGE: Hey, hey I asked the guy if he had a ticket!

KRAMER: Alright, what time is it?

[George looks at his watch]

GEORGE: Twenty after ten.

KRAMER: Alright, they got one at the Paradise at ten forty-five.

ELAINE: No, I don't wanna go to a mini-plex multi-theater!

GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?

ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POW's to show them propaganda films.

GEORGE: Alright, I'm going.

ELAINE: Well what about Jerry?

KRAMER: Alright, you guys go get the tickets, I'll wait right here.

GEORGE: Terrific. Alright, alright come on.

[George and Elaine leave]

[Kramer looks longingly at the Papaya King sign across the street]


[In a taxi with Jerry and Buckles]

BUCKLES: So then when I was twelve the whole family moved from Bensonhurst to Sheephead Bay.

JERRY: Mmm hmm.

BUCKLES: We live right on the water. The whole atmosphere stunk from fish. You know that fishy smell I'm talking about?

[Jerry is getting anoyed]

JERRY: Yeah, yeah the fishy smell.

BUCKLES: To this day I won't eat fish. Do you eat fish?

JERRY: Yes! Yes I eat fish!

BUCKLES: I don't know how you can eat that crap!

JERRY: [To the taxi driver] Take the Park!

BUCKLES: No no no, take fifty-fifth. No, there's beautiful homes there. Lovely, talented, attractive people there.


[At the Paradise George succeeds in obtaining the tickets and he joins Elaine in the ticket holders line]

GEORGE: Got them.

ELAINE: Beautiful!

GEORGE: Hey, you know what else is playing here?

ELAINE: Huh.

GEORGE: "Rochelle Rochelle."

ELAINE: Ugh.

GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seeing that.

ELAINE: Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most pointless, boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.

GEORGE: So what's your point?

GEORGE: Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.

ELAINE: Oh, alright. Can you break a twenty?

GEORGE: No, I don't, I don't have any change.

ELAINE: Oh well, then I'll pay you later.

GEORGE: Or, I could take the twenty, I could, I could pay you later.

ELAINE: Yeah, you could...

GEORGE: Might be easier.

ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.

GEORGE: Either way.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's the same thing

GEORGE: So... can I have it?

ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.

GEORGE: What do you mean "get the popcorn and the soda"?

ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda and we'll call it even.

GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, I will buy you a popcorn and soda and I'll throw in a bon-bons.

ELAINE: George, you're sapping my strength.

[The line begins to move]

ELAINE: What about Kramer and Jerry?

GEORGE: Alright, I'll wait out here for them. You go in and save seats.

ELAINE: Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!

GEORGE: Go on, save them.

ELAINE: No, but George! George!

[With extreme reluctance Elaine goes on ahead to save seats]

[George stands there and looks over at the Rochelle Rochelle movie poster]


[In a taxi stuck in traffic]

JERRY: Fifty-fith, great idea, Saturday night theatre traffic, good move!

BUCKLES: I wonder how my attorney would react in traffic. You better move that car girl for I bust you up. What about Jose Philesiano. It's noboy I can't see. I had to sit here for two hours, I don't think so. It can be anybody. People down through history reacting in traffic. Franklin Roosevelt. Driver...

JERRY: Alright! Alright! I got the bit!

BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.

JERRY: That's very nice of you, I can't do the voices.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Don't start up with me!

JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab.

BUCKLES: But Jerry, quit riffing!

JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?

[Short pause]

BUCKLES: Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?


[Elaine does her best to save three seats]

ELAINE: No, these are saved.

MANINSIDETHEATRE: All of them?

ELAINE: Yeah.

ELAINE: Come on, you can't take four seats.

ELAINE: What, is that a rule?


[George quits waiting outside the theatre and walks in]


WOMANINTHEATRE: Are these your things?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Elaine, they didn't show. I can't any more I'm going to miss the beginning.

WOMANINTHEATRE: We'll take these seats. Would you please remove your stuff.

ELAINE: No no, they'll be here.

WOMANINTHEATRE: But I am here, they are not!

ELAINE: They're comming. George listen, run over to the Paragon and give Kramer the two tickets so they can come in, okay?

[Someone tries to take the seats]

ELAINE: These are taken, taken. If you hurry back you won't miss the beginning.

GEORGE: Why don't you go and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.

[Someone tries to take the seats]

ELAINE: No, taken, taken, taken. I'm getting the hang of it.

[George returns to one of his favorite topics]

GEORGE: Why don't you give me the twenty and I'll stop and get change and then you and I can uh, you know, settle.

ELAINE: Can we do this later, George?

GEORGE: What's the point of even discussing it? You'll give me the money when you have it.

[He takes two steps, then reconsiders, then reconsiders again]

GEORGE: I, I trust you.


[Kramer stands, mesmerized by the sign that reads: "100% Pure Fresh Beef. Tastier than Filet Mignon." He rushes to the ticket booth]

KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? Ah, you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh, a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?

[The ticket woman just stares at him]

[Kramer takes off for the hot dog]


[Elaine is accosted from all sides]

ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. They're in the lobby buying popcorn. What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!

WOMANINTHEATRE: Which one?

ELAINE: These two and this one. No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! They're taken!

[She can't take it any longer]

ELAINE: Ah, take them.

[She snatches up her coat from the seat and the people sit down in them]


[George reaches the ticket booth of the Paragon]

GEORGE: Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, a pointed nose?

MOVIECLERK: Flared nostrils?

GEORGE: Yeah.

MOVIECLERK: Nope, haven't seen him.

[George leaves unsuccessful]


[Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.]

BUCKLES: Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, please let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?

JERRY: Your trench coat in my closet?

BUCKLES: Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills. I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.

JERRY: I can't keep your coat in my closet.

BUCKLES: I'm sorry you feel that way.

JERRY: Well, that's life.

BUCKLES: Hey, your freinds aren't here.

JERRY: Oh, they must be inside. I'm just going to run inside and tell them I can't make the movie.

BUCKLES: We should see "Rochelle Rochelle." I hear it's really hot.

JERRY: No thanks, maybe some other time.

BUCKLES: Really? Do you really mean that?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BUCKLES: You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?

JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.

[Jerry hands Buckles his half of the cab fare]

JERRY: Here. See you later.

BUCKLES: Do you want me to wait for you?

JERRY: No, don't wait!

BUCKLES: Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure you get in, that's all.

[Jerry approaches the ticket counter]

JERRY: Ah, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to them. You mind if I walk through real quick?

[The movie usher indicates "okay"]

[Jerry calls out to Buckles]

JERRY: Go ahead.

BUCKLES: Bye bye.


[Just after Jerry goes inside Kramer clomps to the ticket booth at warp speed clutching a precious Papaya King hot dog in his hand]

KRAMER: Hey, did that guy show up?

MOVIECLERK: The guy with the horse face and the big teeth.

KRAMER: No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.

MOVIECLERK: Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses. Looked like Humpty Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.


[Behind Elaine a women chats loudly with her friend]

WOMANINTHEATRE: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that? And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-syncing to "A Chorus Line", I mean you can see he's got talent.

[Elaine is annoyed]

ELAINE: Excuse me, excuse me?

WOMANINTHEATRE: What's the problem?

[Momentarily shocked as if the answer were self-evident]

ELAINE: You're talking.

WOMANINTHEATRE: It's the "Coming Attractions".

[Elaine collects her things and leaves]

WOMANINTHEATRE: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a...


[At the entrance to the Paradise Twin George is stopped by the usher]

MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: Uh, I just went out. I went to look for my friend?

MOVIEUSHER: Do you have your stub?

GEORGE: My "stub"?

MOVIEUSHER: Uh huh.

[George sifts through his pockets, going on about how he never needed a stub before]

GEORGE: You don't remember me?

MOVIEUSHER: It's a big city, sir.

GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kind of short, big wall of hair, face like a frying pan?

[Unable to find his stub, George gives him Kramer's ticket. The ticket taker tears the ticket and gives George the stub. George goes into the "Checkmate" theater just as Elaine leaves it through the other door. Like two dips, passing in the night]


[George is whispering in the movie]

GEORGE: Elaine? Elaine! Elaine!

[Various movie patrons tell George to shut up]

GEORGE: Elaine!

[He is quickly shouted down, making his escape through the exit. The exit to the street]


[In the theater at the Paragon, Jerry is looking for Elaine]

JERRY: Elaine.

[The movie narrator can be heard, "The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk."]

[Something about this preview attracts Jerry's attention. Not sure exactly what, though...]

[The movie's narrator can be heard, "It's a story about life, and love, and becoming a woman. "Rochelle Rochelle", now playing at Paradise Two."]


[Meanwhile, Kramer gives up waiting outside the Paragon. Seconds thereafter, Jerry rushes out of the theater and hails a cab, or tries to]


[Elaine reaches the concessions stand and has to deal with the perky clerk]

ELAINE: Uh, could I have a medium diet Coke?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Do you want the medium size or the middle size?

ELAINE: What's the difference?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Well, we have three sizes. Medium, large, and jumbo.

ELAINE: What happened to the small?

CONCESSIONCLERK: There is no small. Small is Medium.

ELAINE: What's... medium?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Medium is large, and large is jumbo.

ELAINE: Okay. Give me the large.

CONCESSIONCLERK: That's medium.

ELAINE: Right. Yeah. Could I have a small popcorn?

CONCESSIONCLERK: There is no small. Child size is small.

ELAINE: What's medium?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Adult.

ELAINE: Do adults ever order the child size?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Not usually.

ELAINE: Okay, give me the adult.

CONCESSIONCLERK: Do you want butter?

ELAINE: Is it real butter?

CONCESSIONCLERK: It's butter flavored!

ELAINE: What is it made of?

CONCESSIONCLERK: It's yellow!


[Leaving the inanities of modern marketing aside, we switch to Jerry, still outside trying to hail a cab. He finally gets one. The driver speaks with a Russian accent]

JERRY: Forty-fourth and ninth.

TAXIDRIVER: Have you got a cigarette?

JERRY: No.


[George once again tries to get past the ticket-taker]

MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!

MOVIEUSHER: I need to see your stub.

GEORGE: I've got the stub.

[George empties his pockets in a quest for a ticket stub. No dice]

GEORGE: There you go, okay? That's my other friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.

[George goes past the concessions stand, not seeing Elaine, who is searching her pocketbook for change to pay for her popcorn and drink]


MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

KRAMER: Uh no, see my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late and she's inside.

MOVIEUSHER: Go ahead.


[George dwells at the "Rochelle Rochelle" sign for what must be the 5th time this episode. Kramer heads straight into the theater] 

KRAMER: Is that seat taken?

WOMANINTHEATRE: It's all yours.

[Kramer lankily stumbles into the seat, but finds the fit uncomfortable]


TAXIDRIVER: I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.

JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?

TAXIDRIVER: No! Impossible! It is on empty!

[Jerry nervously glances at his watch]


[Elaine returns to the theater, arms laden with popcorn and soda trying to find her seat. Various patrons tell her to sit down already. She is finally shouted down and pushed out of the aisle causing her to spill most of her popcorn in the process. George sits in a half empty theater watching "Rochelle Rochelle". Not a female audience member in sight]

[A man's voice can be heard, "You're soaking wet. Who are you?"]

[Rochelle's voice can be heard, "My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk."]

[A man's voice can be heard, "Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold."]

[Rochelle's voice can be heard, "Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open."]

[George is clearly waiting to see Rochelle's other buttons]

[Rochelle's voice can be heard, "Oh, that's much better. Much..."]

[A tall man sits down in front of George, blocking his view of Rochelle's Christmas cards. Elaine stumbles to the ticket taker trying to shake popcorn out of her hair]


ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh...

[She shakes more popcorn]

ELAINE:  I just went to get popcorn, okay? And, and, and somebody took my seat and my coat is in there!

MOVIEUSHER: There's a seat in the front row.

ELAINE: No no, I can't sit in the front row.

MOVIEUSHER: Well, you're going to have to wait then.

ELAINE: I can't stand around here for two hours!

MOVIEUSHER: I could let you see "Rochelle Rochelle".

ELAINE: Oh thanks.

[Elaine plods off then realizes she had something else to say]

ELAINE: Oh hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus with a, with a bird face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?

MOVIEUSHER: Haven't seen him.


[Meanwhile, at a service station, the taxi driver assures Jerry that they will be leaving very soon. He'll just go across the street to buy a cigarette]


[From his pocket, Kramer digs into his treasured Papaya King hot dog. Then discovers the source of his discomfort. He's sitting on a coat]


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: Hey, did I make it?

KERNIS: Sorry.

JERRY: Oh great. That's great. What a night.

[Off-screen, we hear appreciative applause]

[The Comedy Club announcer can be header, "Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen. Another round of applause for Pat Buckles!"]

[Jerry spots Buckles]

JERRY: You got my spot?

BUCKLES: That athlete's foot bit killed!

JERRY: Really.

BUCKLES: Do you think I need to lose some weight?

JERRY: Weight? Nah, just need some more height. My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies.

BUCKLES: Come on, we can still catch most of "Rochelle Rochelle".

JERRY: "Rochelle Rochelle", huh?

BUCKLES: A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

JERRY: Minsk?


[George and Elaine watch "Rochelle Rochelle" in different parts of the theater. Also there are Jerry and Buckles. George and Buckles seem to be enjoying the movie, Jerry and Elaine can't deal with it]

ELAINE: Oh, give me a break!

[George turns, as does Jerry]

JERRY: Elaine?

[Elaine's face lights up]

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: Elaine!

VOICEINTHEATRE: Shut up.

GEORGE: Jerry?

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Elaine?

ELAINE: George!

[He waves hi]

JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?

VOICEINTHEATRE: Will you shut up?

ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!

JERRY: Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

BUCKLES: You're leaving?

JERRY: Yeah.

[The music from the movie continues over the next, heart-rending scene]

BUCKLES: Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.

JERRY: I don't want the coat.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!

[Jerry, Elaine, and George fill each other in on their respective miseries out in the lobby]

GEORGE: Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.

JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!

GEORGE: I still paid for it!


[Kramer wanders out of "Checkmate", his newly found coat draped casually over his shoulders. Jerry looks through his wallet]

JERRY: I only have a twenty.

ELAINE: That's my coat! Give me that. Where did you get that?

KRAMER: It was on the seat.

ELAINE: You took my seat!?

GEORGE: You uh, owe me for the ticket.

KRAMER: Yeah right.

ELAINE: What is that stain on my coat?

KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the beginning? Oh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out.

[He whispers to imaginary friends seated around him]

JERRY: "Why did they kill that guy? Why did they kill him? Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't really with them. I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him."
