[Jerry and Kramer are walking on the street]

JERRY: So you’re saying UNICEF is a scam?

KRAMER: It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation. No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.

JERRY: Oh no, it's Sally Weaver.

[We see Sally from a distance]

KRAMER: Oh yeah, your old college roommate huh?

JERRY: No, it's Susan Ross's old college roommate. She moved to New York a few years ago. She's trying to become an actress.

KRAMER: Hmm, Dramatica comedia heh!

JERRY: Untalented. She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.

KRAMER: We don't go to enough theater.

JERRY: She should just give up.

[She recognizes them]

JERRY: Hey!

SALLY: Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from. I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break.

KRAMER: Why don't you just give up?

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. Alright, we go grab some bouffe. Join us?

[Kramer leaves both Sally and Jerry speechless]

JERRY: So... Susan's dead.


[At Monk's Cafe]

KRAMER: I think she was happy someone finally said it.

JERRY: Why'd you have to say anything to her?

KRAMER: Felt that the conversation was lagging.

JERRY: Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?

KRAMER: I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.

[He pushes Jerry out of the booth and leaves]

ELAINE: You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up. I have.

JERRY: What did you wanna be?

ELAINE: I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.

JERRY: I don't either.

ELAINE: And you're on the fringe of the humor business.

[George comes in]

GEORGE: Hey!

ELAINE: Hey! George look at this.

GEORGE: That's cute.

ELAINE: You got it?

GEORGE: No, never mind.

ELAINE: Come on, we're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.

JERRY: It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.

ELAINE: The cat is saying, "I've enjoyed reading your e-mail."

GEORGE: Maybe it's got something to do with that forty-two in the corner.

ELAINE: It's a page number.

GEORGE: Well, I can't crack this one.

ELAINE: Ah! This has got to be a mistake.

GEORGE: Try shaking it. Well, Janet should be here any minute.

JERRY: You've been hiding her from us. You must really like her?

GEORGE: Ah, the minute I saw this girl we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. Hmm her eyes, her mouth, nose.

ELAINE: We know what a face consists of.

[Janet arrives]

JANET: I'm sorry I'm late.

GEORGE: Jerry, Elaine, I give you... Janet.

JANET: Nice to meet you.

ELAINE: Hi!

JANET: Do we still have time to make the movie?

GEORGE: Oh, uh yeah. We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.

[George goes to the cashier and empties out the candy bowl, they leave]

ELAINE: Jerry, she looks exactly like you.

JERRY: She does not.

ELAINE: Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.


[At Jerry's apartment. Kramer is already there making himself a lunch]

JERRY: Hey Kramer.

KRAMER: Hey! You got some messages. Yeah, George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman, but that was a crank call. And some Sally woman called said, "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life."

JERRY: What! You're the one who ruined her life.

KRAMER: Well that's not how she remembers it.

JERRY: Well, I got to talk her out of this.

KRAMER: I thought you said she stinks

JERRY: She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route. Years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.

[Door buzzer rings]

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: Hey! George and Janet.

KRAMER: Ah, who's Janet?

JERRY: George's girlfriend. Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say, kooky talk.

KRAMER: You know what woman I always thought you looked like? Lena Horne.

[George and Janet enter]

GEORGE: Hey hey!

KRAMER: And you must... look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this, you're like twins. Woo! This is eerie.

GEORGE: Kramer, what are you talking about? Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry

JANET: well maybe we do look a little like each other.

GEORGE: No um, what do you know about what you look like.

KRAMER: Come on George, relax. Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.

GEORGE: Alright now we're going bye bye.

JANET: We just got here George

GEORGE: Well, it's getting dark.

[They leave]

KRAMER: Yeah, she's a nice girl, kind of quiet though.

[Jerry slaps him on the back]

JERRY: What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I.

KRAMER: Well how should I have "broached the subject"?

JERRY: You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.

KRAMER: Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.

JERRY: Yeah! Because of you.

KRAMER: Well, I think one of us should leave.

[They stare at each other for a while]


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.

SALLY: Uh huh!

JERRY: You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear. You stink, you suck. We like magic.

SALLY: Really?

JERRY: Of course, I stink, you stink. Its show biz, everybody stinks.

SALLY: Yeah! You've been stinking since the eighties.

JERRY: Alright, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.

SALLY: Right! Yes! Thank you I'm gonna do it.

[She starts to eat her food]

JERRY: Now!!

[She leaves in a hurry]


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: Well, I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

JERRY: Oh, I think we're at the bottom.

[George enters]

ELAINE: Hey George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.

GEORGE: What does that mean?

JERRY: Yeah. What does that mean?

GEORGE: What do you mean by that?

ELAINE: Enjoy.

[She leaves]

JERRY: Elaine huh? She's completely...

GEORGE: Oh, I know. Because you don't think Janet...

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Why would I...

JERRY: It's ludicrous.

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: For either one of us...

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: So.

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: I'm not gay.

GEORGE: Neither am I.

JERRY: Kramer!

GEORGE: Kramer! Kramer, get in here!

JERRY: Where's the crazy man, Come on up.

GEORGE: Come on in here.

[As Kramer steps out and comes in]

GEORGE: Ha!!

JERRY: What's happening? What are you doing, come and talk to us.

KRAMER: I've made an important life decision.

JERRY: Let’s talk about that.

GEORGE: Don't leave.

[George slams the door]

KRAMER: Alright. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately. First with that girl whose life you destroyed and um, about George dating a lady Jerry.

GEORGE: What's the decision?

KRAMER: I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.

JERRY: Yeah right.

KRAMER: What do I need to talk for? For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop how George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that. Now it's time for silence.

GEORGE: Silence! Yes!!

JERRY: Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.

KRAMER: Jerry, ninety-four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.

[Kramer mimics somebody angry saying "What are you talking about" twice and then some crying]

JERRY: Well what does this mean?

KRAMER: Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she Jerry.

GEORGE: Shut up!! Shut up!! Shut up!!

[George leaves]

KRAMER: That's the idea.

JERRY: Kramer there's no way you stick to this.

[Kramer makes a zipper gesture to his mouth]

JERRY: Oh! You just starting now?

KRAMER: That's right. Oh!! Right now.

[Kramer turns abruptly and hit his knees on the coffee table]

KRAMER: Ouch!! Now!!


[The next day at the New Yorker]

ELINOFF: So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?

ELAINE: Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier, people won't be so quick to return the clothes. For example, I, I really do, well I love this one

[Elaine shows him the cartoon]

ELINOFF: Oh yeah, that's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think?

ELAINE: Ah, Ah yeah. But why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?

ELINOFF: Well Miss Benes, cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer.

ELAINE: Well, you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?

ELINOFF: Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores.

[Slides the magazine to her]

ELAINE: But, what is the comment?

[She slides the magazine back to him]

ELINOFF: It's a slice of life.

ELAINE: No it isn't.

ELINOFF: Pun?

ELAINE: I don't think so.

ELINOFF: Vorshtein?

ELAINE: That's not a word. You have no idea what this means do you?

ELINOFF: No.

ELAINE: Then why did you print it?

ELINOFF: I liked the kitty.

ELAINE: You know what? You people should be ashamed of yourself. You know, you doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.

ELINOFF: Actually, that's not bad.

ELAINE: Oh really? Well you know, I have others.

 
[At the Samuel Beckett Theatre]

JERRY: Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a one woman show?

SALLY: No no, it's just a little performance piece I wrote. You know what? You really inspired me, okay, a tear.

[Kramer joins Jerry just as the show starts]

JERRY: Ah! There you are.

[Kramer motions silence]

JERRY: Alright, code of silence. How's that going?

[Applause, Sally starts her show]

SALLY: Hi everybody, think you're really going to like this because it's about me. Alright, it's not just about me, it's about me and this guy, Jerry Seinfeld. Who I like to call, The Devil. Okay, Okay so I run into this Jerry on the street and he says to me, "Sally, you stink. You should give up acting." Oh! I'm doing Jerry now so you've got to imagine I have horns, a tail and hooks instead of feet.

[Big laughs from the audience and Kramer is cracking up]

JERRY: Oh, shut up!!!


[The next day at Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: She does a full hour about how you're the devil? I got to go see this thing.

JERRY: Good luck. It's sold out for the next three weeks.

ELAINE: Well, I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from... The New Yorker.

JERRY: The New Yorker?

ELAINE: Yes, The New Yorker. I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon made no sense!

JERRY: Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew

ELAINE: Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.

JERRY: Nodding off.

ELAINE: And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.

JERRY: Wow! That's incredible. But you don't draw.

ELAINE: I do to.

JERRY: What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face, the transparent cube...

ELAINE: It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.

JERRY: Where did you see that? Those are private!!


[At Monk's Cafe]

SALLY: Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?

JERRY: No no, I thought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.

SALLY: Well, that is the title.

JERRY: I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.

SALLY: You know I work shopped that and... snoozers!! But I'll tell you what I'll think. It's all a journey.

JERRY: You got a little shmootz there.

[He picks something on her sweater]

[Newman shyly approaches the table]

NEWMAN: Excuse me, Miss Weaver? Oh my God, it is you! I, I've seen your show six times.

JERRY: What a surprise.

NEWMAN: You're great, it's great, it's so great to see a show that's about something.


[Kramer climbs into a cab]

CABDRIVER: Where to?

[Kramer realizes that he can't talk so quickly gets out of the cab]


[At Janet's apartment]

GEORGE: My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry, what does that mean? That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her and that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted. She doesn't even look like Jerry.

SALLY: You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.

GEORGE: I know.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[The TV newscaster is heard, "Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show."]

SALLY: Okay, so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like, "Hey stop doing your show." And I'm like, hello! It's a free country. So then he goes, "Okay Shmootsie" and he starts pulling at my sweater right? He's getting, you know, hands across America.

JERRY: There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her.

SALLY: And this is what he looks like when he's eating.

JERRY: Get out of my house!!

[Elaine walks in the door looking terrible]

ELAINE: Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.

JERRY: If I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.

ELAINE: That is not the point.

JERRY: Some mouthwash, a hat, something.

ELAINE: Just read it!

JERRY: Pretty good.

ELAINE: Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem. Kramer look it.

[Kramer stays silent]

ELAINE: What? It's funny.

JERRY: It's a pig at a complaint department.

ELAINE: And he's saying, "I wish I was taller."

[She laughs]

ELAINE: See? That's his complaint.

JERRY: I get it.

ELAINE: Do you! Because that's not a normal complaint.

JERRY: How about if it was something like, "I can't find my receipt, my place's a sty."

ELAINE: Everything with you has to be so jokey.

JERRY: I'm a comedian.

ELAINE: I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. That's real.

JERRY: Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.

ELAINE: I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. That's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! You know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.

JERRY: Oh, that's it! I'm gonna put an end to this.

[Picks up a phone and dials Sally's number. Kramer taps on a sheet of paper that he gives to Elaine to read]

ELAINE: The pig says, "My wife is a slut."

JERRY: Now that's a complaint. Hello Sally? Yeah, this is Jerry. I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and...

[Instant switch to the club where Sally is playing the message that Jerry left on her message]

JERRY: I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.

JERRY: That's it I'm calling in the big guns.

[Still Sally's act but seen on his TV back in his apartment]

SALLY: To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed, cry baby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Okay, but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld.

[Censored beep]

SALLY: You.

JERRY: How could she say that on TV? And how did she get a cable special? I've never gotten a cable special. Well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado.

[Kramer is silent on the couch beside him]

JERRY: Exactly.


[At Peterman's office. Elaine posted her cartoon on her door]

ELAINE: Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker, huh! Funny isn't it?

[Dugan shrugs]

ELAINE: Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say? Nothing. 
[She laughs]

PETERMAN: Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.

ELAINE: Can I fix that after lunch sir?

PETERMAN: Oh, no right away, chop chop. Oh, a new cartoon. "I wish I was taller."

[He laughs]

PETERMAN: I'd like to see that complaint get rectified.

[He laughs some more and leaves]

ELAINE: You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? Because I wrote it.

DUGAN: You shouldn't make fun of pigs.

[He leaves]

[Peterman returns]

PETERMAN: Flash of lightning Elaine, I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.

ELAINE: Oh? Do tell sir.

PETERMAN: It's a Ziggy!

ELAINE: A Ziggy?

PETERMAN: That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.

 
[In a restaurant later that evening]

GEORGE: You know, you know what's great about our relationship? It's not about looks.

JANET: It's not?

GEORGE: No, can't be. For instance, I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.

JANET: I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.

GEORGE: But after that we really talked didn't we?

JANET: Well, you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before.

GEORGE: Nah, no. This relationship has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble. What else happened?

JANET: You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.

GEORGE: Alright, yes! Gum! Good enough I'll take it.

JANET: I like gum.

GEORGE: I do too. You see that's what we're about. You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.

JANET: I have gum in my hair.

GEORGE: I'm losing it


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Sally enters and approaches Kramer]

SALLY: Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy. Mind if I sit? My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? You should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day. How weird is that? I know. At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! Take three steps back, get a life, okay. But then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean? But who am I? Anyway, I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person...

KRAMER: Now you gotta shut up!

[Sally is speechless]

KRAMER: I'm sorry, I, I haven't spoken in days.

SALLY: Well, lay it on me string bean.

 
[At Janet's apartment. She is in the bedroom]

JANET: Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed.

GEORGE: Okay look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else. Anything. Please.

JANET: George.

[George turns around to see Janet with short Jerry like hair and a Jerry like blue shirt]

GEORGE: Your hair?

JANET: Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed George.

[George speeds out the door]

GEORGE: George is in big trouble.

 
[At Jerry's the next day]

JERRY: You ripped off a Ziggy?

ELAINE: It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets. Did you read the comics today?

JERRY: I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas."

[She laughs]

JERRY: See that's funny because it's real.

[Kramer comes in]

ELAINE: Hey look it, Sally's cable show's on.

[Kramer turns around to leave]

JERRY: Hey Kramer, come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.

SALLY: Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.

JERRY: That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?

ELAINE: Why are you yelling at the TV?

SALLY: Okay, get this. I heard he makes his best friend date a women that look just like him. Hello issues.

JERRY: Elaine, have you been talking to her?

ELAINE: Hey! I'm just a fan.

[She laughs]

SALLY: Oh, and speaking of issues, guess who got a no polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?

JERRY: I thought you stopped talking??

KRAMER: Alright, starting now.

 
[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! How short?

GEORGE: Like that.

[He looks at Jerry]

JERRY: You mean like...

[He points to his hair]

GEORGE: That.

JERRY: So she...

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: And you don't...

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: So...

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: Hmm.

GEORGE: We must never ever speak of this again.

JERRY: No no.

[Long pause. They stare at the walls]

JERRY: Hey uh, you want to see a movie?

GEORGE: Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off.

JERRY: I think that's for the best.
