[At a comedy club]

[Jerry is just now getting done with his act]

JERRY: Thank you! Goodnight!

[He walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him taking Jerry by surprise]

SALLY: Jerry!

JERRY: Hey. Hey!

SALLY: Sally Weaver!

[She sees Jerry's expression, he still has no clue who she is]

SALLY: Susan Ross's roommate from college. Hello!

JERRY: Right. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?

SALLY: Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.

JERRY: Oh thanks.

SALLY: No no, I mean it. You're very funny.

JERRY: I believe you.

SALLY: Oh anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you out to dinner.

JERRY: Oh I'm sorry, I can't. I'm going straight to the airport.

SALLY: Oh, that's too bad. Susan thought we'd really get along. I guess because we're both wacko!

[Jerry laughs]

SALLY: You know what, um...

[She turns around and picks up a large gift from a table]

SALLY: You have to give this to them for me, okay? Here.

[She hands the box to Jerry. He struggles under the size of it]

SALLY: It's a wedding present.

JERRY: Oh?

SALLY: And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.

JERRY: Uh huh.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George and his father Frank are sitting at a booth]

FRANK: George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.

GEORGE: I am aware.

FRANK: So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?

GEORGE: A billiard parlor?

FRANK: Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar. Give it real authenticity.

[Elaine enters. George spots her in mid-sentence]

GEORGE: Well, that's... Elaine!

ELAINE: Oh hi, Frank.

GEORGE: Sit down. Join us, please.

ELAINE: Actually, I gotta get to the uh, thing.

GEORGE: Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.

ELAINE: Okay.

[She sits down. George laughs]

ELAINE: So... Frank, did George ever show you that photo?

GEORGE: What photo?

ELAINE: You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?

FRANK: There's a Costanza in Tuscany? Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?

ELAINE: I didn't talk to anyone. I was just walking by and I saw the sign and I thought George might get a kick out of it.

FRANK: I gotta get that picture, it could be my cousin, Carlo.

ELAINE: Who is that?

GEORGE: When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.

FRANK: I played with him every day until the age of four and then we separated.

ELAINE: So, you weren't born here?

FRANK: No. That's why I can never be president. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. They don't want me, I don't want them!

GEORGE: I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas.

FRANK: Don't bring me down. Do you have another copy of that photo?

ELAINE: No, I, I don't. But, well, the Maestro might.

FRANK: The Maestro? What Maestro?

ELAINE: He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.

GEORGE: Really? Why?

ELAINE: Because he hasn't called me since we got back. I spilled wine on his eight by ten photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.

GEORGE: Who?

ELAINE: You know the Three Tenors?

GEORGE: Yeah. Pavarotti, Domingo, and uh, the other guy.

ELAINE: The other guy.


[On an airplane]

[Jerry's flying to NY. On his lap is Sally's present and his personal bag. He's trying to read a magazine while a stewardess approaches him]

STEWARDESS: Could I take that box for you?

JERRY: Uh well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.

STEWARDESS: Oh, then I'll have to put your bag in the over head.

JERRY: Oh, okay.

[The stewardess takes the bag and crams it into the over head compartment. The sound of glass breaking can be heard]

STEWARDESS: There we go.

[Jerry gives a face of pure dissatisfaction]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Kramer enters while Jerry's unpacking. The clothes in his suitcase are covered in barbeque sauce]

JERRY: Oh, look at this.

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: I bought a bottle of barbeque sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this stupid thing.

KRAMER: Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce.

JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.

KRAMER: I see.

JERRY: No, you don't see because I'm going on the show this week and this was going to be my bit on the show.

KRAMER: Well, why don't you do your material?

JERRY: I'm out.

KRAMER: Well, you better get to work.

JERRY: Thanks for the tip.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hey buddies.

JERRY: Hey. Hey, this is for you. It's from uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.

GEORGE: Oh yeah. Sally called Susan, said you guys really hit it off.

JERRY: Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box.

[He looks over at Kramer who is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it]

JERRY: What the hell are you doing?

KRAMER: I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?

[He eats the bread]

[George is still opening the gift and flinging Styrofoam peanuts all over the table]

JERRY: Hey hey hey. Come on, come on.

KRAMER: Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?

JERRY: Like what?

KRAMER: Well, uh... "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff? And why do they make it so small?"

JERRY: Where's the punch line?

KRAMER: It's all attitude.

[He makes a humorous face mocking Jerry's]

[George takes out a mat from the huge box]

GEORGE: Well, this is certainly a crappy gift.

JERRY: A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!

GEORGE: Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes. She's a big executive for Federal Express.

JERRY: Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!

KRAMER: Look, it's personalized. "The Costanzas"

GEORGE: No no, forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.

KRAMER: Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.

GEORGE: I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.


[In George's old bedroom]

[The room is remodeled into a billiard room. The pool table is obviously way too big for the room. Frank and Kramer are chalking up their sticks]

KRAMER: So, what's your game? What do you like to play?

FRANK: Eight ball.

KRAMER: No, nothing doing. Let's you and me play a game of straight pool, hmm?

FRANK: You like to gamble, Cosmo?

KRAMER: Yeah, now and then. You know how it is.

FRANK: Five dollars a game, huh?

KRAMER: I'll break.

FRANK: Okay.

[Kramer goes to pull back his pool stick but it is stopped short by the wall. Scene cuts to a montage with multiple scenes involving humorous accounts of them trying to play in such a tiny room]


[At George and Susan's apartment]

[Susan has boxes in the living room and is setting up some of her items around the apartment]

GEORGE: What's all this?

SUSAN: Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.

GEORGE: More stuff.

SUSAN: Oh, I put up my doll collection.

[George walks into his room and stops in his tracks. Up on the shelves is a doll that looks exactly like George's mother]

GEORGE: Oh my God! What is that?!

SUSAN: What? What is it?

GEORGE: This doll looks like my mother.

SUSAN: George, it's a doll.

GEORGE: I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!

SUSAN: Oh, get out of here.


[In George's old bedroom]

[Kramer is holding the pool stick at an awkward angle and is about to hit the ball when Estelle enters]

ESTELLE: What's going on in here?

[Kramer hits the cue ball and it jumps up from the table and flies off screen]

ESTELLE: Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!

FRANK: We still haven't finished the first game.

ESTELLE: The first game?!

KRAMER: Well, we're still uh, learning the subtleties of the table.

FRANK: He knows the Maestro. He could have the picture.

ESTELLE: Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.

FRANK: You don't know that!

[Estelle leaves, slamming the door]

FRANK: We're gonna go see him, huh?

KRAMER: As soon as the game is over.

FRANK: Oh boy.

KRAMER: Eleven, corner pocket.

[He pulls back on his stick and accidentally crashes it into the window]


[In George and Susan's bedroom]

[George and Susan are in bed. They go to kiss but George stops when he sees the doll lying right next to Susan]

GEORGE: What is this thing doing here?

SUSAN: Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl.

[Susan leans in to kiss but George stops her again]

GEORGE: Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

SUSAN: Why?

GEORGE: I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.

SUSAN: Oh, stop it.

[They kiss. While kissing, George tightly stuffs the doll under Susan's pillow out of sight]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry enters the living room from his bathroom with his toothbrush. Elaine is reading the paper at his table]

JERRY: Hey Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got, the Orident.

ELAINE: Oh yeah?

JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!

ELAINE: Oh, that's dynamite.

JERRY: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?

ELAINE: Who else is on the show?

JERRY: Uh, one of the three tenors.

ELAINE: The Three Tenors? Which one?!

JERRY: Uh, it's not Pavarotti, it's not Domingo...

ELAINE: The other guy?!

JERRY: Yeah, the other guy.

ELAINE: My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!

JERRY: Why?

ELAINE: Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?

JERRY: Why not?

ELAINE: Wow! The other guy!

[George enters. He's in a disheveled state]

JERRY: Hey, you look awful.

GEORGE: I'm on no sleep, bro.

JERRY: Problem in the bedroom?

GEORGE: Susan has the doll collection. One of the dolls looks exactly like my mother. She likes to sleep with it.

[Elaine makes a face]

JERRY: Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?

GEORGE: Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.

[He takes off his glasses and rubs his eye]

GEORGE: It's freaking me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.

JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat.

GEORGE: I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.

JERRY: Sally? Wait, wait a minute. She's coming to New York?

GEORGE: Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.

JERRY: Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!

ELAINE: Who's Sally?

GEORGE: Susan's college roommate.

JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.

GEORGE: So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.

JERRY: I will, don't worry. In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!

ELAINE: That's sounds pretty juvenile.

[He pulls out a toy from the cereal box. He displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling]

JERRY: Hey! A dinosaur!


[At the Maestro's office]

[Kramer and Frank are in a meeting with the Maestro]

FRANK: His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.

MAESTRO: Unfortunately those photographs are at home.

KRAMER: Well listen, if you bring them by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool. Yeah, Frank here, he's got his own billiard room.

FRANK: Yes, It's uh, it's uh, uh, what do you call it, Kramer?

KRAMER: A billiard room.

FRANK: No, not billiard. Not billiards. It was, come on already. Come on.

KRAMER: What?

FRANK: We call it the uh...

KRAMER: The place to be!

FRANK: The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.

MAESTRO: Ah, then I shall be there. And now Gentlemen, if you will excuse me I must prepare for the symphony.

KRAMER: Oh yeah?

[The Maestro gets up. Realizing that he isn't wearing pants, Kramer and Frank stare in bewilderment]

MAESTRO: Oh, my pants.

[He begins putting on a nearby pair of pants]

MAESTRO: It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.

KRAMER: Really?

MAESTRO: You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.

[Kramer and Frank are obviously impressed]

KRAMER: That's good thinking.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is presenting the doll to Jerry and has his arms out in a "tada" gesture. Jerry has on a disgusted face]

GEORGE: You see? You see?!

JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.

GEORGE: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!

JERRY: Why don't you just get rid of it?

GEORGE: I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.

[He grabs the doll and opens the door to leave]

GEORGE: Susan's so attached to this thing.

JERRY: Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.

[George shoots him a look, then leaves. He is audible as he meets up with Elaine in the hallway]

GEORGE: Hi Elaine.

[Elaine shrieks out in fright, then enters Jerry's doorway, breathless]

ELAINE: Did you see that?!

JERRY: I'm just glad it's out of here.

[Elaine exhales deeply, getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment]

JERRY: What's that?

ELAINE: Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.

JERRY: Oh.

[The intercom buzzes. Jerry answers it]

JERRY: Yeah?

SALLY: It's Sally.

JERRY: Oh, did you bring the barbeque sauce?

SALLY: A whole case.

JERRY: Excellent. So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: How come? I told you, it's fantastic.

ELAINE: Eh, I like mine.

JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?

ELAINE: I don't want it.

JERRY: I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better, it's much better.

ELAINE: It doesn't matter to me.

[A knock on the door]

JERRY: Come in.

[Sally enters with a medium-sized box]

SALLY: Well, here I am!

JERRY: Oh hi. Elaine, this is Sally.

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: How was your flight? Pretty uncomfortable?

SALLY: Actually, the seat next to me was empty so there was no problem at all.

JERRY: Oh.

[He starts to open the box]

JERRY: Oh wait...

[He holds up one of the barbeque jars]

JERRY: This isn't the sauce that I asked for!

SALLY: That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"

JERRY: No no, I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!

SALLY: This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis we think that other sauce is kind of a joke.

JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. Nothing!

SALLY: You could just do your material.

JERRY: I don't have any material!

ELAINE: He's got nothing!


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George is sitting at the table opposite the doll. While he eats his meal, he can hear his mother yelling at him via the doll]

ESTELLE: Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!

GEORGE: Don't tell me how to eat!

[People from nearby tables turn and look at him]

ESTELLE: You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!

GEORGE: Because I like this one!

[He notices people staring at him so he quickly gets up and collects his coat and the tiny replica]

GEORGE: Come on, let's go, let's go!

[On his way out he stops in front of a woman blocking his path]

GEORGE: Oh, hi.

[Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out]

DEENA: That man should really be in a sanitarium.


[In George's old bedroom]

[The Maestro, Kramer, and Frank are all without pants and playing pool while listening to classical music. Frank is looking at the Maestro's pictures with a magnifying glass]

KRAMER: Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet my pants remain perfectly creased.

FRANK: It's him! It's Carlo Costanza!

KRAMER: Come on. Are you sure?

[They all crowd around the picture]

FRANK: I'd know him anywhere.

MAESTRO: I've seen that man in Tuscany, eccentric fellow, reputation of being kind of a village idiot.

FRANK: I still say we're related.

MAESTRO: Oh, I love this piece.

[He turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments]

KRAMER: Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.

FRANK: I can't make anything.

KRAMER: Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.

FRANK: Follow through? What do you mean?

KRAMER: Right here, come on, I'll show you.

[He gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him]

KRAMER: Take hold of your stick. Alright, bring it back slowly.

[Estelle walks in with a tray of beverages and popcorn. Kramer and Frank continue the lesson in their underwear as she stares in disbelief]

FRANK: It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

ESTELLE: Oh my God!


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle and now I got nothing to talk about.

ELAINE: Well, have you ever considered writing new material?

JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.

ELAINE: Me? Are you talking about me?

JERRY: No. You're never here.

ELAINE: Boy, that doll was really freaky wasn't it?

JERRY: Yeah. Really. Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Show the doll, show the picture of George's mother, it's pretty funny. I'm gonna call them.

[At George's apartment. Sally answers the ringing phone]

SALLY: Hello?

JERRY: Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.

SALLY: Hi Jerry, it's Sally!

JERRY: Oh. Is George there?

SALLY: No, but he should be home soon.

JERRY: Uh listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.

SALLY: Is this for your comedy routine?

JERRY: Yes.

SALLY: Don't worry. I'm on the case.

[Jerry makes a face of doubt as he hangs up]


[In George's old bedroom]

[The same pool game is going on. The Maestro is putting his pants on]

MAESTRO: I uh, think I'll get some air.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back]

KRAMER: See, this is no good.

[He looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton]

KRAMER: Hey, the baton.

[He chalks it up]

KRAMER: I got a hunch fat man I can't miss.

[He measures up his shot]

KRAMER: Thirteen in the side pocket.

[He makes the shot]

KRAMER: Giddy up.

[He moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move]

KRAMER: Six in the corner.

[He makes the shot]

KRAMER: This table's mine.

[A series of Kramer's plays are displayed and on the last ball of the game]

KRAMER: You know where it's going.


[In The Charles Grodin Show dressing room]

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hey!

ELAINE: Is George here?

JERRY: Not yet.

[She points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs]

JERRY: The other guy.

[Elaine gasps. Smiling, she walks over to him]

ELAINE: It's... you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?

CARRERAS: My pleasure.

[He reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster]

ELAINE: Oh, thank you so much.

[He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp]

ELAINE: Thank you so much, Mr...

[She tries to read his signature]

ELAINE: Camaro.

[Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up]

ELAINE: Mr. Casea?

[He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face]

ELAINE: Well, whatever. I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.

JERRY: Well, that's one hell of a gig.

[He turns around and picks up a box labeled "Orident"]

JERRY: Hey look, I got something for you. The Orident!

ELAINE: Oh... thank you. Huh. Why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?

JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism. It, you know, needs lots of packaging.

ELAINE: How am I supposed to carry this thing?

[She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off]

ELAINE: What are you doing?

JERRY: Well, I want to sit down.

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants.

[He folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up as if to say "I'll see you" and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute]


[In George's old bedroom]

[The game is over]

MAESTRO: Madam, you have been an extremely gracious hostess.

[He kisses her hand]

ESTELLE: Oh, thank you, Maestro.

[She giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves]

FRANK: Here, take a look at this.

ESTELLE: Yeah, what is it?

FRANK: It's Carlo. I found him!

ESTELLE: You've been cooped up in this room too long.

FRANK: You never support me! Let's see what George says about this. Where're my pants?

[He takes his pair off a rack and leaves]

[Kramer takes his pair off and inspects them]

KRAMER: Aw, beautiful!


[In the Charles Grodin Show dressing room]

[Sally walks in with a bag. Jerry's sitting without any pants on]

SALLY: Hey there, Mr. hairy legs!

JERRY: Where's George?

SALLY: Don't worry, I brought your doll.

[She pulls out an extremely different doll. This one resembles a baker]

SALLY: Tada!

JERRY: No! That's the wrong doll!

SALLY: Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about. Not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat. I think it's a riot!

JERRY: This is a nightmare.

SALLY: Oh well, I'll be watching. Don't screw up.

[She leaves]

[View shifts over to Carreras. While eating some BBQ food he reaches back for a towel to wipe his face. He happens upon Jerry's pants]

CARRERAS: Too much sauce.

[He wipes his mouth]

JERRY: My pants!

[A stage manager enters]

STAGEMANAGER: Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.


[On the street]

[Elaine's walking down with the poster and the box. A man exiting an ice cream parlor almost runs into her. Scene cuts to her on the subway. The man standing next to her is bumped and his beverage spills all over Elaine. Luckily, she held the poster up before it could be damaged. Scene cuts to the Maestro's office]

MAESTRO: Elaine? What a surprise.

ELAINE: I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.

MAESTRO: Oh. Orident, that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about.

ELAINE: No no no, not the toothbrush.

[She holds out the poster]

ELAINE: This.

[The Maestro takes the poster and dramatically rolls the rubber band off. He unravels the poster on his desk]

MAESTRO: Oh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with... those two other guys. Oh Elaine, this is magnifico!

ELAINE: Oh well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.

[A stagehand is yelling from off-camera, "Maestro, you're on!"]

MAESTRO: Oh Elaine, wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.

ELAINE: Oh, okay!

[She picking up the Orident box and knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster]

[At the Maestro's concert. Various players are practicing as he walks out. A round of applause sounds as the Maestro bows. Picking up his bent baton, he addresses the orchestra. As he starts to instruct the band, he stops when he finds out his baton is bent out of shape. He turns and looks at the audience apologetically as the music fades to a stop]


[At George and Susan's apartment]

[Susan's holding her doll defensively]

SUSAN: I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.

GEORGE: I just wanted a second opinion.

[There's a knock at the door. George sighs, then answers it, it's Frank]

[Frank holds up a picture]

FRANK: Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother...

[His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would]

ESTELLE: Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!

FRANK: Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous!

[He struggles with Susan for possession of the doll]

FRANK: Come here!

SUSAN: No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!

[Frank manages to get the doll from Susan. He twists the head clean off the body]

[Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it]

FRANK: There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!

GEORGE: I told you it looked like her.


[A street in Tuscany]

[Frank meets up with a man sweeping the sidewalk, the man he believes to be his cousin. He sets a gift he's brought down]

FRANK: Carlo! It's me, Frank!

[He attempts to hug the guy, but he resists, pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language]

FRANK: I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?

TUSCANYMAN: Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.

FRANK: What do you know. Alright.

[He picks up his present]

FRANK: I guess I was wrong.

[He walks off]
