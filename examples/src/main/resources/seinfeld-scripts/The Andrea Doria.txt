[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry's sitting at the table reading the paper. George bursts into the room]

GEORGE: Jerry! Georgie's moving out!

JERRY: Get out!

GEORGE: I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.

JERRY: Is it better than mine?

GEORGE: Oh yeah.

JERRY: So, it's a two bedroom, one bath, make your friends hate you?

GEORGE: You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call.

JERRY: She's out.

GEORGE: Oh right, the blind date.

JERRY: Yeah well, they like to call it a set up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.

GEORGE: Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.

JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.

GEORGE: Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet.

JERRY: Oh, this is really annoying.

GEORGE: It's working already!

[They both leave]


[At the Manhattan Mini-storage]

[Jerry and Kramer both go up to a unit door. Kramer's pulling a wagon full of junk. He starts to cough uncontrollably]

JERRY: What is with that?!

KRAMER: Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expels the diseased germs out of the body into the air.

[Kramer makes a gesture of germs being in the air]

[Jerry takes out his key to unlock the unit door]

JERRY: Where is your key?

KRAMER: Yeah, well uh, Newman. He's, he's got it.

JERRY: You know Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.

KRAMER: Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.

[He starts coughing again]

[Jerry opens the door and mail bags start spilling out of the unit]

JERRY: Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?

KRAMER: Evidently.


[At George's new apartment]

[George is moving in. The place is bare. A woman walks in while he's attempting to hang a lamp near the fire place]

RICARDI: Excuse me, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, uh, no menus.

RICARDI: No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi, president of the tenant's association.

GEORGE: Oh, right!

[He shakes her hand]

GEORGE: Right! Hey hey, I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me!

[He dribbles an imaginary ball toward Mrs. Ricardi. She backs off defensively]

GEORGE: Come on!

[He stops and laughs right before running into her]

RICARDI: No no. Uh George, unfortunately Clarence Eldridge in eight C has decided that he wants the apartment.

GEORGE: Yeah, but you, you promised it to me.

RICARDI: Yes, but you see, Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.

GEORGE: Well, the Andrea Doria. That was quite a fire.

RICARDI: Shipwreck.

GEORGE: I remember.

[He leaves]


[At a restaurant]

[Elaine is sitting alone waiting for her date Alan. She's thinking to herself]

ELAINE: Where is this guy?! I hate this! I should of brought something to read.

[She picks up a sugar packet]

ELAINE: "Cancer in laboratory animals." Huh.

[A waiter approaches]

ELAINESWAITER: Excuse me, Elaine Benes?

ELAINE: Yeah?

ELAINESWAITER: An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. He's been stabbed.

ELAINE: Stabbed?!

ELAINESWAITER: More bread?


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: You ate more bread?

ELAINE: That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!

JERRY: Did you find out who stabbed him?

ELAINE: Yeah, it turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

JERRY: Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.

ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I mean, think about it Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I mean, to be stab-worthy. You know it's kind of a compliment.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey. How's everybody?

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Eh.

[He picks up a carton of food]

KRAMER: No expiration date on this.

[He opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food]

JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.

KRAMER: Nah, no no no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes men all towing the company line. Plus, they botched my vasectomy.

JERRY: They botched it?

KRAMER: I'm even more potent now!

[Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face. George enters]

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey. How's the new place?!

GEORGE: Gone. The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor.

ELAINE: Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?

JERRY: Edmund Fitzgerald.

ELAINE: I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

JERRY: No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

GEORGE: You could fit fifteen people in that bathroom.

ELAINE: I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.

JERRY: Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.

KRAMER: The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog twenty-one miles off the coast of Nantucket.

[Everyone's taken back by Kramer's knowledge]

GEORGE: How do you know?

KRAMER: it's in my book, "Astonishing Tales of the Sea". Fifty-one people died.

GEORGE: Fifty-one people?! That's it?! I thought it was like, a thousand!

KRAMER: There were sixteen hundred and fifty survivors.

GEORGE: That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? Thirty? Forty?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? 

[He starts walking towards the door. Kramer grabs his food and follows]

KRAMER: Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks."

[George opens the door and enters Kramer's apartment. Jerry stops Kramer before he can do the same]

JERRY: Hey uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail out of there?

KRAMER: Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it.

[He leaves]

[Jerry nods his head like it was expected]


[At Newman's apartment]

[Jerry knocks on the door as it opens slowly. Newman's sitting on the couch, watching TV in a state of depression]

JERRY: Newman?

NEWMAN: I guess.

JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail out of my storage unit.

NEWMAN: Sometimes we don't get what we want.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

NEWMAN: I didn't get my transfer.

JERRY: "Transfer"?

NEWMAN: To Hawaii. The most sought after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy sweet you don't even have to like the stamps. But it's not to be. So, I'm hanging it up.

JERRY: You quit the post office?

NEWMAN: Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.

JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.

NEWMAN: And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.

JERRY: Well, a law's a law.

[He leaves]


[In Central Park]

[Kramer's sitting on a bench coughing. A man walking some dogs passes. A coughing other than Kramer's can be heard. Kramer stops the man]

KRAMER: Okay, hold on there. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?

MANWALKINGDOG: What cough?

[One of his dogs, Smuckers, coughs. Kramer reacts while pointing to the dog]


[At a Restaurant]

[Elaine's on a date with Alan]

ELAINE: I love shrimp!

[She waves her knife around as she's talking]

ELAINE: I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp in front of me.

[She waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it and even more so with every wave]

ELAINE: And I will eat it until my stomach pops!

[She notices Alan's unsettled]

ELAINE: Oh.

[She puts the knife down]

ALAN: No, it's okay. I'm still just a little bit jumpy.

ELAINE: Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?

ALAN: Just one of those things, you know.

ELAINE: What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or?

ALAN: I don't know, could be.

[A woman passes. She stops in front of Elaine and Alan's table]

CAROL: Alan?!

ALAN: Carol?

[Carol grabs his hot coffee and throws it in his face, then storms off. Alan screams from the pain]

ELAINE: Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!

ALAN: No, that was a different girl.

[Elaine looks confused]


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?

ELAINE: Right, so, I called my friend, you know the one who set us up. I found out he's a bad breaker upper.

JERRY: Mmm. Bad how?

ELAINE: Well, you know when you break up how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean but he means them.

JERRY: I follow. So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE: Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean to me that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.

JERRY: What's more important?

[Elaine shrugs, then Jerry shrugs, then Elaine, then they both get into sort of a shrug-off]


[On a NYC street]

[While Kramer's walking with his new found dog, Smuckers, he meets up with George. Kramer and the dog both start coughing]

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: What's with the dog?

KRAMER: Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him.

[He starts coughing]

GEORGE: Oh.

[Smuckers coughs]

KRAMER: Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.

GEORGE: A vet?

KRAMER: Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog all on the same day.

GEORGE: So, if I may jump ahead, you're gonna take dog medicine?

KRAMER: You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers?

[Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave]

KRAMER: I'll see you.


[At George's apartment building]

[George approaches Mr. Eldridge as he's entering his new apartment. George is carrying Kramer's sea tales book]

GEORGE: Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.

ELDRIDGE: Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

GEORGE: I tell you, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. The buffet, that's the real ordeal huh, Clarence?

ELDRIDGE: We had to abandon ship.

GEORGE: Well, all vacations have to end eventually.

ELDRIDGE: The boat sank.

[George holds up Kramer's book]

GEORGE: According to this, it took ten hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath, no offence. So uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment and letting me shove off in this beauty?

ELDRIDGE: Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you.

[He enters his apartment and slams the door behind him]

GEORGE: It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stockholm may not have sunk you, but I will!


[At the Vet's office]

[Smuckers is getting examined by a vet]

VET: What are the symptoms?

KRAMER: Well uh, it hurts when he swallows. Especially when he drinks orange juice.

[The vet gives him a look]

KRAMER: I mean uh, dog food juice. What's worse, he has a nagging cough.

[Smucker's coughs]

KRAMER: Yeah, that's it. That's it.

VET: Yeah, well uh, we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?

KRAMER: What? No. That's disgusting.


[At Monk's Cafe]

ALAN: So that's it? We're uh, we're breaking up?

ELAINE: What? Break up? We went out on one date.

ALAN: Okay, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say.

ELAINE: Alright, good. Good.

ALAN: Okay then, well, so see you around... big head.

[He gets up to leave]

ELAINE: Pardon?

ALAN: You got a big head. It's too big for your body.

[He walks for the door]

ELAINE: That's it?!

[She laughs]

ELAINE: That's the best you got?!

[She laughs loudly as Alan leaves]


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was like forty years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past thirty years up to and including yesterday!

JERRY: You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".

GEORGE: I should!

JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.

GEORGE: I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!

JERRY: You're the man!

[There's an urgent knocking at the door. Jerry answers it. Newman's standing in the doorway]

NEWMAN: Jerry!

JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.

[He slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going]

JERRY: So, you want a protein shake or something?

GEORGE: Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go.

[He opens the door, letting Newman in and leaves]

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: I need that mail, where is it?!

JERRY: What's the difference?

NEWMAN: The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!

JERRY: Well go ahead, there's eight bags of it.

NEWMAN: Blast! There's no way I can handle eight in addition to my usual load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii!

[He moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed]

NEWMAN: I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever!

[He lays down on Jerry's couch]

NEWMAN: The dream is dead.

JERRY: You're giving up that easy?

NEWMAN: I usually do.

[He gets up to leave]

NEWMAN: See you.

JERRY: No, wait a minute Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!

NEWMAN: What are you proposing?

JERRY: Whatever it takes for as long as it takes me where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!

NEWMAN: An alliance?

JERRY: An alliance.

[They both shake hands and laugh evilly]

JERRY: Now get the hell out of here.

[Newman leaves]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry's sorting mail out on his table]

ELAINE: Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?

JERRY: Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home, my home Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.

ELAINE: Well anyway, get this. I spoke to Alan. You know I told him I didn't want to see him anymore. He called me "big head".

JERRY: "Big head" That's almost a compliment.

ELAINE: It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.

[The phone rings. Jerry answers it]

JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey George.

GEORGE: Yeah listen, I can't make it later.

JERRY: You can't make it?

GEORGE: Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So uh, I gotta kind of get ready. I'll see you.

JERRY: Alright.

[He hangs up]

ELAINE: Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?

JERRY: Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

ELAINE: Alright, well I'll see you.

[She opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off]

JERRY: Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

[He pulls a bottle out of his pocket]

KRAMER: I got some pills. They taste terrible.

JERRY: Just swallow them.

KRAMER: No, my throat's too tender.

JERRY: Alright, sit down, sit down.

[He grabs a pill from the bottle and starts advancing toward Kramer like an owner with his dog]

KRAMER: I don't want to!

[Jerry forces Kramer onto the couch. Kramer resists violently, much like a dog would]

JERRY: Come on. Just sit down!

KRAMER: Jerry! What?!

JERRY: Sit down! Sit down!

KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth!

[He grabs Kramer's head]

JERRY: Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!

[Jerry forces the pill into Kramer's mouth, then holds Kramer's mouth shut for a few moments. Thinking Kramer's already swallowed it, he lets go. Instantly, Kramer spits the pill out into the air. Jerry sighs, giving up]

JERRY: What kind of pills are these anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? These are dog pills!

KRAMER: We have the same symptoms.

JERRY: But he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.

KRAMER: No no. No doctors.

JERRY: Alright.

[He heads for the door, grabbing his coat]

KRAMER: Where are you going?

JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?

KRAMER: I don't know..

JERRY: Come on, you wanna go for a ride?

[He starts jiggling his keys as if he's calling out for a dog]

JERRY: Huh? Come on! Come on!

[Kramer eagerly gets up and runs out the door. Jerry follows Kramer out]


[In a taxi cab]

[Elaine's riding in the back seat of a taxi]

CABBIE: Lady, could you move your head a little bit?

ELAINE: What?

CABBIE: Your head. I can't see out the back.

[Elaine slumps down in her seat]

CABBIE: Little more.

[Elaine slumps lower]

CABBIE: Little more.

[She slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen]

CABBIE: Thank you.


[In Jerry's car]

[Jerry is driving to an unknown destination. Kramer is restless in the back. He's scrambling around, looking out the windows just as a dog would]

KRAMER: I don't see any tissues back here.

[He looks out the windows]

KRAMER: Wait a minute! This isn't the way to the park! Where are we going? I recognize this block! You're taking me to the doctor!


[George is at Monk's Cafe with his parents]

GEORGE: So uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.

ESTELLE: I feel a draft. Let's change tables.

FRANK: Get out of here! We have a booth.

ESTELLE: Frank, I'm cold!

FRANK: Order a hot dish.

ESTELLE: Why can't we sit over there?

FRANK: That's not a booth!

ESTELLE: So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!

FRANK: I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that!

ESTELLE: Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!

[A moment passes]

GEORGE: Mom, dad.

FRANK: Now George, what do you want to know about your childhood?

GEORGE: Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.

FRANK: Where's that breeze coming from?


[On a NYC street]

[Jerry's car is parked outside of the doctor's office. Kramer refuses to get out of the car]

JERRY: Kramer, out of the car. Out, now!

KRAMER: No, Jerry!

JERRY: Alright, that's it.

[He grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car]

KRAMER: No! Don't!

[Jerry pulls Kramer out onto the sidewalk. Kramer quickly gets up and takes off running down the street]

JERRY: Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!


[At the tenant board room]

[Mr. Eldridge is telling his story to the board members. Each one looked touched by the tale. George, on the other hand, is bored to death. He's leaning back in his chair in the corner of the room, knocking on the wall to display how bored he is]

ELDRIDGE: Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was...

[He stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls]

ELDRIDGE: It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.

RICARDI: Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.

[George gets up, walks over to Mr. Eldridge, then gestures for him to give up his chair. Eldridge reluctantly gets up and takes George's seat in the corner]


[At Newman's apartment]

[Jerry enters. Newman has an ice pack on his ankle]

JERRY: Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? What happened?

NEWMAN: Kramer bit me!

JERRY: Bit you?!

NEWMAN: We had an argument about me going to Hawaii and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hobbled! I don't think I can do my route and they're awarding the transfer in two days!

JERRY: Well, what if I deliver it?

NEWMAN: You?!

[He laughs hysterically]

NEWMAN: You can't deliver mail!

JERRY: Well, why not?

NEWMAN: I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes.

JERRY: What am I gonna wear?

NEWMAN: I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.

JERRY: I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!

[Scene cuts to Jerry on Newman's route. He's walking along a city street with a mail cart. He stops in front of a store owner sweeping the sidewalk]

JERRY: There you go. Merry Christmas!

STOREOWNER: Mail on Sunday?

JERRY: Oops.

[He continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking]


[At the tenant board room]

[George is telling the board his astonishing life stories. Every board member seems to be deeply moved by them]

GEORGE: I was handcuffed to the bed... in my underwear, where I remained...

[Scene cuts to another story]

GEORGE: She was attractive. She was also, in fact, a Nazi...

[Cuts to another story]

GEORGE: The water that I had been swimming in was... very cold. And when I dropped the towel, there was... significant shrinkage...

[Scene cuts to yet another story]

GEORGE: Her parents were looking at me. So there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.

[Scene cuts to his closing statements]

GEORGE: In closing, these stories have not been embellished because they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. Thank you.

[Every member of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing]

GEORGE: Oh, also... my fiancee died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out.

[Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members]

GEORGE: Thanks again.

[He leaves. Eldridge looks defeated]


[At Newman's apartment]

[Jerry returns to get another bag of mail]

JERRY: Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box like you told me but sometimes it says like, "Photographs, Do not bend".

NEWMAN: "Do not bend".

[He laughs evilly]

NEWMAN: Just crease, crumple, cram. You'll do fine.

[The Phone rings. Newman answers it]

NEWMAN: Hello? This is he. I don't understand. Very well.

[He hangs up in disappointment]

JERRY: What?

NEWMAN: That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!

JERRY: How did they know?!

NEWMAN: Too many people go their mail! Close to eighty percent. Nobody from the post office has ever cracked the fifty percent barrier! It's like the three minute mile!

JERRY: I tried my best!

NEWMAN: Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.

[Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat]

JERRY: You know, this is your coat.

NEWMAN: Damn!


[In Central park]

[Elaine passes a man on a bench. All the sudden a bird flies right into Elaine's head and falls to the ground. The bird regains it's balance and flies off. The man on the bench is staring in awe]

MANONBENCH: He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it.

ELAINE: Really?

MANONBENCH: Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head.

[Elaine covers her head with her hands and runs off]


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat. I mean, come on.

JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. So, when do you move into the apartment?

GEORGE: They're making their decision today.

[Elaine enters. She has a scarf over her head trying to tie her hair down. She looks angered at something]

JERRY: What's the matter with you?

ELAINE: Nothing. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak head.

JERRY: What giant freak head?

ELAINE: The one that sits atop my disproportionately puny body. I'm a walking candy apple!

JERRY: So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!

ELAINE: What? Yeah, you're right! All I have to do is call him up and sit with him and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off... or jam a fork into his forehead.

JERRY: Either way.

ELAINE: Alright.


[At a restaurant]

ALAN: I want to apologize for...

ELAINE: Oh, please.

ALAN: So you have a big head.

ELAINE: So what?

ALAN: It goes well with that bump in your nose.

ELAINE: What?!


[Scene cuts to the outside of the restaurant. A woman runs out of the restaurant and stops a passing Kramer]

WOMAN: Please! Get help! There's a crazy big headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!

[Kramer takes off running down the street, looking for a cop. He meets up with two officers exiting an ice cream shop. Before he can tell them the urgent message, he starts coughing uncontrollably]

FIRSTCOP: Boy, that's some cough you got there.

[Kramer keeps coughing while making gestures]

SECONDCOP: No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it?

[Between coughs, Kramer manages to say the word "trouble"]

FIRSTCOP: Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's trouble?

[Kramer coughs out the words "Old Mill"]

FIRSTCOP: Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my God! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on.

[Kramer starts running back to the restaurant and the cops following him]


[In George's apartment building]

[George enters the hallway only to find that a bandaged up Alan is moving boxes into George's would be apartment]

GEORGE: Excuse me uh, what are you doing in there?

ALAN: I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor.

[They shake hands]

GEORGE: What? Elaine's big head guy? They have you the apartment?!

ALAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Why?! Because you were stabbed and got coffee thrown in your face and uh... 

[He points to Alan's bandaged forehead]

ALAN: Oh, fork in the forehead.

GEORGE: That's why they gave you the apartment?

ALAN: No, I just gave the super fifty bucks.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with thirty-four years of misery!

ALAN: Tough luck, chinless.

[He goes into his new apartment and slams the door on George]

[George starts acting self-conscious about his chin, much like Elaine and her head]
