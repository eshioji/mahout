[Someone off camera says "Elaine"]

JERRY: Elaine. But in the end it's really a show about people.

[He walks over to the couch and sits down on the arm]

JERRY: People who really care about each other and I think that says something... I guess... I don't know. Just watch.

GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.

JERRY: He's got super strength, super speed, I'm sure he's got super humor.

GEORGE: Either you're born with a sense of humor or you're not, it's not going to change. Even if you go from the red sun of Krypton...

[He uses a red ketchup bottle to illustrate]

GEORGE: ...all the way to the yellow sun of the earth.

[He uses a yellow mustard bottle to illustrate]

JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind...

[He picks up the yellow mustard bottle]

JERRY: ...not be affected by the yellow sun of the earth?

GEORGE: I don't know. But he ain't funny.

KRAMER: What's today?

NEWMAN: It's Thursday.

KRAMER: Really? Feels like Tuesday.

KRAMER: I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...

JERRY: Alright, shut up the both of you!


[From the episode: The Implant]

GEORGE: "Double dipped"? What, what are you talking about?

TIMMY: You dipped the chip. You took a bite.

[He points at the dip]

TIMMY: And you dipped again.

GEORGE: So?

TIMMY: That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip, just take one dip and end it!

[Kramer is at Dr. Reston's office (Elaine's Psychiatrist)]

KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, do you have a uh, decaf cappuccino?

DRRESTON: I don't think we have that.

KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.

DRRESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink

DRRESTON: This is an office.

KRAMER: That's true.


[From the Episode: The Virgin]

[Marla (The Virgin), Jerry, and Elaine are in Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa and my diaphragm goes flying.

[Jerry slightly raises his arm to try and stop Elaine from speaking any farther]

ELAINE: So I just froze, you know, ah! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there.

[Jerry again tries to stop Elaine from speaking]

ELAINE: So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed. So I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? 
[Jerry is staring directly at her trying to get her attention]

ELAINE: Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?

[From the episode: The Boyfriend Part 1]

[Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and Newman are in Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: I hate Keith Hernandez, hate him.

NEWMAN: I despise him.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

KRAMER: Let me tell it.

NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it.

KRAMER: You always tell it.

NEWMAN: Alright, tell it.

KRAMER: Just tell it

NEWMAN: June fourteenth nineteen eighty-seven. Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp.

[Cut to a film of the day, like the Zabruter film, with the umbrella man and everything. Oh so brilliant parody!!!]

KRAMER: Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us. As he passes Newman he turns and says, "Nice game pretty boy." Keith continued past us up the ramp.

NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.

ELAINE: What was it?

KRAMER: He spit on us, and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet off him and it hit me.

ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times. Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then came off the rib, turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in mid air mind you, makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic loogie.

[Not that that approach was going to work, or anything, but what minute chance they had of convincing her is blown away as the door bursts open and...]

KRAMER: Hey, Come on! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!

ELAINE: On occasion.

JERRY: And the guy never knows?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: How can he not know that?

ELAINE: Because I was good.

JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.

[Jerry and George laugh]

ELAINE: You didn't know.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: You didn't know.

JERRY: Are you saying...

[George clears his throat and calls a waitress]

JERRY: You faked with me?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You faked with me?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: You faked it?

ELAINE: I faked it.

JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?

[Jerry, Elaine, and George are in a booth at Monk's Cafe]

WAITRESS: Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.

GEORGE: Yeah. No no no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of tuna on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, not toasted with a side of potato salad... and a cup of tea.

[He laughs]

ELAINE: Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.

JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, because salmon swim against the current...

[He makes a hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current]

JERRY: ...and the tuna swim with it.

[He makes a hand motion of the tuna swimming with it]

GEORGE: Good for the tuna.

[A blonde looks at George]

ELAINE: Ah, George, you know that woman just looked at you.

GEORGE: So what? What am I supposed to do?

ELAINE: Go talk to her.

GEORGE: Elaine, bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don't approach strange women.

JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.

GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.

JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.

GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day. So now I will do the opposite and I will do something!

[He goes over to the woman]

GEORGE: Excuse me, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.

VICTORIA: Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.

JERRY: Oh... You mean... shrinkage.

GEORGE: Yes. Significant shrinkage.

JERRY: So you feel you were short changed.

GEORGE: Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.

JERRY: Well, so what's the difference?

GEORGE: What if she discusses it with Jane?

JERRY: Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

GEORGE: How do you know?

JERRY: Women aren't like us.

GEORGE: They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?

JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.

GEORGE: How do women know about shrinkage?

JERRY: Isn't it common knowledge?

[Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room]

GEORGE: Elaine!

JERRY:  Elaine! Get!

[She enters]

GEORGE: Do women know about shrinkage?

ELAINE: What do you mean, like laundry?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...

ELAINE: It shrinks?

JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!

ELAINE: Why does it shrink?

GEORGE: It just does.

ELAINE: I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.

JERRY: What?

RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second.

[He gets up and runs to the bathroom]

JERRY: What?

I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.

GEORGE: I got about fifty feet out and suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell you he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said: "Easy big fellow!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! 

JERRY: Mammal. 

GEORGE: Whatever. 

KRAMER: Well then, what did you do next? 

GEORGE: Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, face to face with the blow hole. I, I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but I knew something was there. So I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction! 

[George reaches into his inside jacket pocket and dramatically pulls something out in his clenched fist holding it up in the air for a second, then displays a golf ball holding it in mid air for the remaining 28 seconds of the scene] 

[Elaine looks on, mouth wide open in amazement. Jerry turns and looks at Kramer also in amazement and George, while staring at Kramer, holds out the ball in the air. Kramer sits quietly, squirming, and it's 21 seconds until Kramer speaks] 

KRAMER: What is that, a Titleist? 

[George silently purses his mouth and nods at Kramer] 

KRAMER: A hole in one eh?

[Jerry and George are at Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: So we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing. 

GEORGE: Exactly. 

JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing." 

GEORGE: There you go. 

[A moment passes] 

JERRY: I think you may have something here.


[From the episode: The Parking Garage]

[Exterior shot of a Chinese restaurant, then inside]

GEORGE: Look, why don't you two just go to the movies by yourself. I'm not in the mood 

ELAINE: Well me either. I'm going to Sky Burger. 

JERRY: So you're not going? 

ELAINE: You don't need us. 

JERRY: I can't go to a bad movie by myself. What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers? I guess I'll just go to my uncle's. 

GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving? 

ELAINE: What for? Let's just get out of here! 

[They all leave] 

BRUCE: Seinfeld, four.
