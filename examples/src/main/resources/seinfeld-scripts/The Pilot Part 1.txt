[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have A.A. type meetings for these people? They'll go, "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream colored couch." According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.


[Jerry is entering his apartment followed by Kramer]

KRAMER: Why, why can't I play Kramer?

JERRY: Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!

KRAMER: Neither are you.

JERRY: I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act? Come on, you say something, I'll pretend its funny, come on.

JERRY: My grandmother's in the hospital.

[Kramer laughs hysterically]

KRAMER: Your grandmother's in the hospital!

JERRY: This is real believable.

KRAMER: What, what you didn't think I was really laughing?

JERRY: It stinks.

KRAMER: Alright, let me see you do it.

JERRY: Say something funny.

KRAMER: Alright, uh, I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.

[Jerry tries to laugh hysterically]

KRAMER: Mine was better than that! Come on look.

[He starts to laugh again, Jerry too]

[George enters while they're both laughing]

GEORGE: Why are two pretending to be laughing?

JERRY: We're acting.

[They stop laughing]

GEORGE: Oh, real good.

[George makes a face like, you stink]

GEORGE: Any word from NBC?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.

KRAMER: Well at least let me audition.

JERRY: He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.

KRAMER: Yeah!

GEORGE: Out of the question.

KRAMER: Oh!

GEORGE: How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russell? What's he doing?

[Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know]


[Elaine and Russell are sitting down at a table in the Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant]

RUSSELL: I really appreciate you coming.

ELAINE: Oh, that's okay. I uh, I don't have much time though. So...

RUSSELL: Alright, well first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just, it's just...

[Awkward pause]

RUSSELL: I don't understand, we went out once and...

ELAINE: Yeah that was two months ago.

[She holds up two fingers]

RUSSELL: Yes I know. I just, I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that, that day in that restaurant when we met.

[We see a flashback from "The Shoes" of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret]

ELAINE: Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want.

[She picks up the bowl of munchies on the table]

RUSSELL: But I want you.

ELAINE: Oh I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels out on the table? Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know who eats these cheesy things.

RUSSELL: Is it something I said... or did?

ELAINE: Um, look Russell, you're a very sweet guy. But um, I got to be honest with you. I don't like television and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in uh, I don't know, Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television. I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.

RUSSELL: Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very, very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young uh, comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, yeah, I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.

RUSSELL: Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.

ELAINE: Really? What is it about?

RUSSELL: Well, really, really it's very unusual. It's about nothing.

ELAINE: What do you mean it's about nothing?

RUSSELL: For example, what, what did you do today?

ELAINE: Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.

RUSSELL: There's a show, that's a show.

ELAINE: Russell, see, I'm, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work.

[She gets up]

ELAINE: So...

RUSSELL: Elaine, uh, When are we, when are we gonna see each other again.

ELAINE: I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry okay? Bye bye.

[Russell watches her leave]


[At Jerry's Apartment]

[Jerry is answering the phone while Kramer is about to go back into his apartment]

JERRY: Hello? Yeah he's here. Hey! It's for you.

KRAMER: Oh yeah?

GEORGE: He's getting phone calls here now?

[Kramer sits down and starts to talk on the phone]

KRAMER: Hello.

JERRY: Again with the sweat pants?

GEORGE: What? I'm comfortable.

JERRY: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world, "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."

[George is baffled]

KRAMER: Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back.

[Jerry and George look at each other]

JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: Uh, it’s NBC.

JERRY: NBC!? Give me the phone!

KRAMER: I'm in the middle of a conversation here.

JERRY: Get off the phone!

KRAMER: Look, I'll call you back. Yeah.

[He hangs up]

JERRY: You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?

KRAMER: Russell Dalrimple's secretary.

JERRY: Alright. Now you're doing something to help me.

[He dials the phone]

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh huh. Okay. Great, thanks a lot.

[He hangs up]

JERRY: Casting tomorrow at NBC four o'clock. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful! 

[George looks disappointed]


[At Dana's office]

GEORGE: What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?

DANA: That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.

DANA: I thought you didn't believe in God?

GEORGE: I do for the bad things.

DANA: Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What, What is that on your lip?

GEORGE: What?

DANA: It's like a discoloration. It's white.

[He gets up and picks a mirror]

GEORGE: Yes. Yes, it's white. Why is that white?

DANA: You'd better get that checked out.

GEORGE: Better get that checked out?

DANA: I would.

GEORGE: What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?

DANA: I'm trying to help you.

GEORGE: What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make them feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor.

[He points at her]

DANA: I think you'd better go.

GEORGE: Oh I'm going baby! I'm going!

[He leaves]


[Jerry and George are in a cab at a light]

JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: Right here.

[He shows Jerry his lip]

JERRY: Get out of here, it's nothing.

GEORGE: Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?

CABBIE: Yeah, it's like a discoloration.

GEORGE: Oh my God.

CABBIE: Yeah, it's all white.

GEORGE: It's all white Jerry! It's all white!

JERRY: Would you stop?

CABBIE: I would get that checked out if I were you.

GEORGE: Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.

JERRY: If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.

GEORGE: Catch what in time?

JERRY: Whatever it is.

GEORGE: You think it's something?

[A man starts cleaning the windshield of the cab]

CABBIE: Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car!

[He starts his wipers]

JERRY: You know these squeegee... oh my God! It's crazy Joe Davola.

[They both hunker down in the back seat]

[Davola looks through cab window]

DAVOLA: Good luck on the pilot Jerry.

[The cab pulls away]


[At NBC]

[Stu and Jay are sitting. George is standing in front of them, asking about his lip. The Casting Director, a woman, is sitting across from them on a couch. Jerry is in the back, standing and looking through the window. There's a box of raisins on the coffee table]

STU: Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.

GEORGE: What do you think it is?

JAY: It's like a... white discoloration.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay guys, are we ready to start?

JERRY: Yeah, where's Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.

[George sits down next to Stu and Jay and grabs a magazine and the box of raisins. Jerry walks over to George and sits next to him.]

STU: Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning. I said hello to him. He walked right past me.

JAY: He must be worried about the fall schedule.

STU: Ah, it's a real bear.

GEORGE: Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?

STU: Yeah. Right.

[The casting director enters with an actor]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George.

[The guy looks very cool and casual and has a lot of hair]

MARK: Hey, how you doing?

GEORGE: Hey Mark, how are you?

[Jerry thinks to himself]

JERRY: They've gotta be kidding.

[George thinks to himself]

GEORGE: This guy's perfect.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.

MARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?

[George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: No, why?

MARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say, "Vandelay Industries".

CASTINGDIRECTOR: I'm Vandelay Industries?

MARK: Right.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: What is that?

MARK: You're in latex.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: What do I do with latex?

MARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.

[The casting director enters with another actor]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Michael Barth. Another George.

[He's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses]

STU: Hi Michael.

JAY: How you doing?

JERRY: Everything alright?

MICHAELBARTH: I just came from the podiatrist. Yeah I got something on my foot, I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate.

[Everyone laughs except George]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Any questions?

MICHAELBARTH: Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?

GEORGE: No, not a loser!

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Uh, let's start with the second scene. You have it here?

MICHAELBARTH: Yeah.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay.

MICHAELBARTH: A man gave me a uh, massage.

[Everyone laughs except George]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: So?

MICHAELBARTH: Um, Uh, he uh, he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was uh...

CASTINGDIRECTOR: He was what?

MICHAELBARTH: Well he was you know... he was touching and rubbing.

[Loud laughter]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: That's a massage.

MICHAELBARTH: I think it moved.

[The casting director enters with a beautiful actress]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Melissa Shannon.

MELISSA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GEORGE: How you doing.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Melissa is reading for Elaine.

MELISSA: It's like a bald convention out there!

[She sees George]

MELISSA: Sorry. I uh, made a faux pas.

JERRY: No you didn't. He knows he's bald.

MELISSA: So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that?

[Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay. Shall we start?

[Melissa and the casting director sit down]

JERRY: Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.

MELISSA: Oh, great.

[The casting director leaves the chair to Jerry. Jerry sits in front of Melissa and slides the chair very close to her]

JERRY: Alright, want to start?

MELISSA: Yeah.

JERRY: Okay.

MELISSA: Ahem. What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

MELISSA: That look you just gave me?

JERRY: I gave a look?

MELISSA: Yes.

GEORGE: Thank you! Thank you very much.

[Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Let's see some more Kramers.


[We see many short scenes with a wide variety of fat, tall, or small actors opening the door like Kramer does. Finally enters Tom Pepper, the guy that will get the role of Kramer]

GEORGE: Hi.

JERRY: How you doing?

TOM: How you doing?

JERRY: Good.

[Tom and the casting director are into a scene]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: What is this about?

TOM: Levels.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Levels?

TOM: Yeah. Get rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted...

[He makes the gesture of carpeting steps]

TOM: ...with pillows.

[Everyone laughs. He sits down]

TOM: Like Ancient Egypt.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?

TOM: Oh... I'll be comfortable.

[Laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table]

GEORGE: Very nice

JERRY: Very good

GEORGE: Very nice Tom, that was terrific.

TOM: May I?

[He points to the box of raisins]

GEORGE: Sure. Thank you for coming in.

[Tom eats some raisins]

JERRY: It was a wonderful reading.

GEORGE: Yeah. Really.

TOM: Well, bye.

GEORGE: Take care. Take it easy.

[Tom leaves with the casting director]

STU: Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.

JERRY: Yeah, I liked him.

GEORGE: What happened to the raisins?

JAY: Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!

GEORGE: Did he just steal the raisins?

STU: You think he stole them?

[The casting director enters with the real Kramer]

CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Martin Van Nostrand.

JERRY: What are you doing here?

CASTINGDIRECTOR: You two know each other?

STU: Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.

KRAMER: That's true.

[Jerry and George look at each other. They're gonna let Kramer have a shot at it. Kramer unfolds the script and smiles at Jerry and George, very confident]

KRAMER: I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in.

[He stops acting]

KRAMER: Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?

STU: I think if you go down the hall it's on the right at the very end.

KRAMER: Yeah. Be right back.

[Kramer leaves]


[We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says, "Sorry buddy, full house." We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant, "Sorry, customers only" He runs into a movie theater, "Hey you need a ticket!" He runs through the park]


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Jerry and Elaine are at a booth]

ELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?

JERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very talented young actress.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Who is it?

JERRY: She's an Eskimo, actually.

ELAINE: Oh my God.

JERRY: She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.

ELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?

JERRY: No, he didn't show up.

ELAINE: You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?

JERRY: No. No you're not.

ELAINE: Why do I keep setting you up?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: Could we get a little more?

[The waitress doesn't listen and walks away]

ELAINE: You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is really slow.

JERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?

ELAINE: Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.

JERRY: Besides that. Look at the waitresses.

ELAINE: Yeah?

[We see that all the waitresses have big breasts]

JERRY: What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?

ELAINE: Ah... ha.

JERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?

ELAINE: Yes, I would say.

JERRY: What's going on here? How is that possible?

ELAINE: Do you think it's a coincidence?

JERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.

[The waitress finally came with the coffee]

ELAINE: Hi. Excuse me. Um, who does all of the hiring waitresses here?

WAITRESSSAMANTHA: He does.

[She points to the manager, Mr. Visaki]

WAITRESSSAMANTHA: In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone.

[She walks away]

ELAINE: You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?

JERRY: Hey that's life. Good looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.


[At the doctor's clinic]

GEORGE: You see, its right here. It's all white.

DOCTORBRUCE: Oh yeah. Yeah. Huh, I've never seen this before.

GEORGE: You've never seen this before?

DOCTORBRUCE: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that.

[George grabs the doctor's arm]

GEORGE: A what?

DOCTORBRUCE: A biopsy.

GEORGE: A biopsy?

DOCTORBRUCE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?

DOCTORBRUCE: Well I don't know what it is.

 
[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: He took a biopsy, Jerry, a biopsy!

JERRY: What did he say?

GEORGE: He said he didn't know what it was.

JERRY: Alright, so?

GEORGE: When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get out of here". That's what I wanted to hear, "Cancer? Get out of here?"

JERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get out of here" kind of personality.

GEORGE: How could you be a doctor and not say "get out of here"? It should be part of the training at medical school. "Cancer? Get out of here! Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"

[Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up]

GEORGE: I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this.

JERRY: Can't you at least die with a little dignity?

GEORGE: No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?

[Kramer enters]

JERRY: Hey. What happened to you yesterday?

KRAMER: I got mugged.

GEORGE: You got mugged?

JERRY: Mugged?

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.

JERRY: Well why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?

KRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerry. I was really percolating. So I decided to run home, you know, through the park and then these two guys they stopped me.

[Door buzzer]

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.

JERRY: What is it?

KRAMER: Well, I uh, I waited so long I... I missed my chance.

JERRY: You didn't go?

KRAMER: No. And now I can't get it back.

[George gives back the sandwich to Jerry and goes to the bathroom]

JERRY: The last thing to do is just not think about it.

KRAMER: How could you not think about it?

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey.

[Kramer mumbles and leaves]

ELAINE: What's the matter with him?

JERRY: He's a little backed up.

ELAINE: Oh.

[George gets back from the bathroom and takes back the sandwich from Jerry's hand and sit on the couch]

GEORGE: Elaine.

ELAINE: So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.

JERRY: Oh, the sisters.

[Elaine goes into Jerry's bedroom]

GEORGE: Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.

ELAINE: So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.

GEORGE: Apply for a job? What for?

ELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory.

[She comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts untucked]

GEORGE: It's a coincidence.

JERRY: This is what you gonna wear?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You're not gonna get the job.

ELAINE: Exactly.

[The phone rings. Jerry gets up and answers it. Elaine sits on the couch's arm next to George and takes a bite of his sandwich]

JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? Alright. Uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye.

[He hangs up]

ELAINE: Who was that?

JERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.

ELAINE: Oh, what about the dogs?

JERRY: They're having sex in the hotel room.


[At Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier]

[Jerry and TV Elaine: Sandi Robbins]

SANDI: So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.

JERRY: Yes.

SANDI: And she's really your ex-girlfriend?

JERRY: Uh huh, yeah.

SANDI: I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.

JERRY: Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, ban Lon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.

SANDI: How would she eat a hamburger?

JERRY: With her hands.

SANDI: What about pasta?

JERRY: Also with her hands.

SANDI: Seriously, I want to experience everything she's experienced.

JERRY: Everything?

SANDI: Everything.

JERRY: Alright she cuts her pasta with a knife.

SANDI: That's good. What's her favorite movie?

JERRY: Shaft.

SANDI: You got to get me a picture. What about sex?

JERRY: She likes talking during sex.

SANDI: Oh, dirty talking?

JERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi...

[He looks at his watch]

SANDI: Elaine.

JERRY: What?

SANDI: Call me Elaine.

JERRY: Alright. Elaine.

SANDI: How does Elaine kiss?

JERRY: Well...

SANDI: Does she kiss... like this?

[She kisses Jerry]

JERRY: Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like...

SANDI: Like this?

[She kisses again but with the spiral]

JERRY: I think you got it.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Kramer and Tom at a the booth behind the cashier]

KRAMER: Now, I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this, look.

[He fakes slurping spaghetti]

KRAMER: Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down.

[A waitress comes to take their order]

KRAMER: Bran flakes, one hundred percent, I got a big problem.

TOM: I'll have a hamburger. That's it.

KRAMER: Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.

TOM: This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.

KRAMER: You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.

TOM: I'm Kramer.

KRAMER: Whoa, I'm Kramer.

[Elaine enters and walks to the manager]

MRVISAKI: What can I do for you? Would you like a table?

ELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.

[He looks Elaine up and down]

MRVISAKI: Have you ever waited on tables before.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I've been a professional waitress for the last ten years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.

MRVISAKI: I don't think I need anyone else right now.

[She sticks here finger in his face]

ELAINE: You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital T.

[She leaves]

MRVISAKI: What? What did I do?


[At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office]

ELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

FREDGANT: Who's Russ Meyer?

ELAINE: Oh, um, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the seventies with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.

FREDGANT: Anyway, go on.

ELAINE: Um, well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses and I went in to apply for the job. And he looked me up and down and he rejected me.

FREDGANT: Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.

PAUL: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

FREDGANT: Paul, the woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large breasted women.

PAUL: Really?
