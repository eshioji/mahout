[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, "Yeah, yeah, they're okay. We're going to stay with the sticks." I mean, I don't know how they've missed it. Thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel. Hello? Shovel! Not going out there plowing forty acres with a couple of pool cues.


[Jerry and Elaine are walking down the street. Elaine is struggling with three grocery bags while Jerry is carrying none. He is pretending not to notice the discrepancy and keeping his hands busy]

JERRY: Good shave today.

ELAINE: Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags. Really I'm fine.

JERRY: I'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in a little.

ELAINE: Can we rest here a second.

JERRY: Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway]

JERRY: So how's Noreen?

ELAINE: Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend, Paul.

JERRY: Already? That was fast. I assume he's not a high talker.

ELAINE: No, but he has the worst habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. You have to go through like, ten minutes of chit chat.

JERRY: A long talker.

ELAINE: Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.

JERRY: Alright, let's move it out.

[Elaine gets her bags and stands up]

JERRY: Hey, isn't that George's father?

[George's father is standing further down the street talking to a mysterious man in a cape and shades]

ELAINE: Oh yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?

JERRY: I've never seen him in Manhattan before. It's weird, so out of context.

ELAINE: That man he's with, is he wearing a cape?

JERRY: I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE: Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY: Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE: Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY: You're right, it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[Elaine positions the bags to cover her face. Jerry walks alongside her so he's out of view too]


[Jerry and Elaine arrive at Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Just uh, plop it on the counter there.

[Elaine drops one bag deliberately onto the floor and throws the others on the counter, payback for Jerry not helping with the bags]

JERRY: Oh! I got a message.

[He presses the button on the answer machine]

GEORGE: Hey, it's George. I got nothing to say.

ELAINE: That sounds urgent.

JERRY: Let me call him back.

[Jerry dials]

JERRY: Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry. I must of dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE: Donna Chang?

[Jerry redials]

JERRY: I should've talked to her, I love Chinese women.

ELAINE: Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY: If I like their race, how can that be racist? Hello? Oh, is this Donna Chang again?! Yes, I am calling George. Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!

[Kramer enters. He's got a bottle of water. Jerry stays on the line to chat with Donna]

JERRY: So listen...

KRAMER: Hi. I'm going through this stuff like water. Who you talking to?

[Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom still on the phone]

ELAINE: He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER: Oh, oh. You know, I dig Asian women.

[Kramer appears a little distracted, adjusting his underwear through his pants]

ELAINE: You got a comfort problem there?

KRAMER: No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE: I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER: No no, well, you know, I wore them for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. My boys need a house!

ELAINE: That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER: Sperm count? Well how many sperm should I have?

ELAINE: A lot!

[Jerry comes back, happy]

JERRY: I got a date!

ELAINE: With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY: She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER: Jerry. Did you ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY: No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER: You ever get a woman pregnant?

JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed.

KRAMER: What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?

JERRY: Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years? Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!

KRAMER: A lot of them! Do you think maybe I'm... depleted?

JERRY: Well, I'm sure you're not... totally depleted.

KRAMER: Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY: So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER: Yeah, but then I'd have to...

[He glances at Elaine]

KRAMER: ...well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day?

ELAINE: What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?

[Kramer leaves, disturbed]

ELAINE: Alright. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY: I am very excited about this date! We're going to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE: She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY: She suggested it!

ELAINE: I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.

JERRY: She's very assimilated.

[Elaine's on the phone. We hear a male "Hello?" on the other end. Elaine slams down the phone]

JERRY: Paul again?

ELAINE: You can't get one ring past him.

[George enters, annoyed]

GEORGE: Hey hey hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY: I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE: Huh?

ELAINE: Hey George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE: Hmm, what's he doing in the city today?

[Elaine and Jerry both shrug]

GEORGE: You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no, looking guilty]

GEORGE: You didn't say hello?

ELAINE: Well, he was with someone. A man... in a cape.

GEORGE: Why was he wearing a cape?

[They both shrug]

GEORGE: Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY: No. Jacket and tie, no cape.

GEORGE: Huh. Cape.

[He turns, distracted, and heads slowly towards door]

GEORGE: What was a man with a cape doing with my father? What was my father doing with a man in a cape?

[He opens the door]

GEORGE: Why a cape? Hmm!

[He leaves]


[At the fertility clinic. Kramer's waiting in an examination room. The Doctor enters]

SPERMDOCTOR: The results of your sperm test are in.

KRAMER: Oh?

SPERMDOCTOR: Um, are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER: Yes! I would like to very much! Well, I'm low, aren't I? I can feel it!

SPERMDOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER: Oh man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never going to procreate.

SPERMDOCTOR: Ah, that's not necessarily true.

KRAMER: What?

SPERMDOCTOR: There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER: Alright, alright. What. What. You tell me, I'll do anything. Come on Doc, tell me.

SPERMDOCTOR: First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER: All the time?

SPERMDOCTOR: All the time. You have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER: Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[Kramer gives the doctor a frustrated look and his body starts shaking]


[At Elaine's. Elaine's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer near the phone]

ELAINE: Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is uh, Noreen there?! Oh. She's not?!

[She hurries to put phone down]

ELAINE: Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called then and... well yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately. Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna...

[A little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored]

ELAINE: Yeah, I took twenty percent too. Um, look it uh...

[She turns the hair dryer on and off]

ELAINE: Paul. The car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.

[She hangs up]


[At the Hunan Balcony. Jerry's in the waiting area sitting next to a Guy. Jerry's tapping his leg, in a good mood]

HOSTESS: Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY: Yes, I will.

CIGARETTEGUY: Do you mind?

JERRY: No, go ahead, I second hand smoke two packs a day.

[Donna Chang enters and walks up to him. She's not Asian. But she is blonde and good looking]

DONNA: Jerry?

JERRY: Excuse me?

DONNA: Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY: Who are you?

DONNA: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY: What do you mean?

DONNA: I mean I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY: You're Donna Chang?

DONNA: Did you think I was Chinese?

JERRY: Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA: Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY: I didn't think so.

DONNA: Used to be "Changstein."


[At Jerry's apartment. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran]

ELAINE: She's not Chinese?

JERRY: No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.

ELAINE: So. What is she?

JERRY: Well, she's... like you.

ELAINE: Oh, how disappointed you must have been.

[She walks to the couch with her cereal]

JERRY: Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang".

ELAINE: So then why are you seeing her again?

JERRY: Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE: Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen. They might be breaking up.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE: Well, maybe.

JERRY: Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you keep hanging up on him?

ELAINE: What do you mean?

JERRY: Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As Elaine considers the implications, Kramer comes in. He's got a pile of underwear in his hands]

KRAMER: Here, take my Jockey shorts.

[Jerry and Elaine leap up in horror]

ELAINE: Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY: Hey, what is that?!

KRAMER: Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY: What, you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER: Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take them.

JERRY: No, I don't want them.

[He starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear]

KRAMER: Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have them near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY: Look! I don't want them!

KRAMER: All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY: I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[Kramer's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants]

KRAMER: Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that, they're bagging up, they're rising in! And there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flipping! I'm flopping!

[Elaine's disgusted and unable to eat her cereal]

KRAMER: What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm going crazy in these things!

[He leaves]

[Jerry looks at the pile of underwear]

JERRY: Well, I'm gonna have to move now.


[At Monk's Cafe. George and his father Frank are at a booth]

FRANK: You know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE: Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK: Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE: So, dad...

FRANK: Gnats too, if I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE: Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK: Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!

GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK: They didn't say hello?

GEORGE: Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK: They couldn't just say hello?! Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE: They uh, said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?

FRANK: Elaine, I can see not saying hello. She's very, what's the word uh, supercilious.

GEORGE: So dad...

[Frank shouts and claps his hands]

FRANK: How could Jerry not say hello?!

[Everyone in the diner turns to look at them]


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Donna Chang. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She puts the phone down]

JERRY: Did they uncross the lines yet?

DONNA: No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

[Long pause. Did he hear "ridicurous"? Should he say something? He can't decide if he should]

JERRY: Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA: Ridiculous.

JERRY: I thought you said, "ridicurous."

[Donna looks puzzled]

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hey.

[He spots Donna]

JERRY: Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE: Oh, I wanted to talk to you. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.

[Jerry indicates he should stay]

GEORGE: Hi, I'm George.

DONNA: Oh! Hi!

[They shake hands]

DONNA: I'm Donna Chang.

[George registers to himself that that is weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances]

DONNA: I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE: You spoke to my mother?

DONNA: She was trying to call you, but...

JERRY: The rines are crossed?

[They both look at Jerry weirdly]

GEORGE: Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"

JERRY: Did I?

DONNA: George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!

GEORGE: Yeah?

DONNA: Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE: Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?

DONNA: Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[Jerry looks shocked. George, calmly as though performing a ritual, goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head inside]


[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Elaine]

ELAINE: Ah, divorced. That's really too bad.

JERRY: Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE: Oh my God!

[He comes out of the bathroom]

GEORGE: You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced and live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY: Gee, I never thought of that.

GEORGE: Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? It's like running a double marathon!

ELAINE: Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY: Have you ever spent any time with these people?

GEORGE: You know what this has to do with?

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: The man in the cape. I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY: And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape. Superman wore a cape. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE: Alright Superman's the exception.

[Elaine looks on in disbelief]

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE: No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER: Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nope.

[He does a little dance]

JERRY: Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY: You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER: Wrong again.

[Jerry realizes]

JERRY: Oh no.

ELAINE: What? What?

JERRY: Don't you see what's going on here? No boxers, no Jockeys...

[Elaine backs away from Kramer]

ELAINE: Oh...

JERRY: The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine. Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER: Oh, it be so. I'm out there Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!!!

JERRY: Don't you need a little... help?

KRAMER: Surprisingly no. I'm free, I'm unfettered.

[He opens the door to leave, still very happy]

KRAMER: I feel like a naked innocent boy roaming the countryside!!

[He leaves]


[At Monk's Cafe. Elaine and Noreen are sitting at the counter]

ELAINE: So you guys are trying to work it out! That's great!

NOREEN: Yeah well, we're trying. But he just went insane there for a while.

ELAINE: Oh, he went insane?

NOREEN: Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE: Well, uh, I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't want to speak to them, ah!

[Noreen realizes]

NOREEN: I can't believe that was you.

ELAINE: I'm really sorry, Noreen.

NOREEN: So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE: Hey Noreen, don't go by me!

[Elaine makes sweeping upward motion with a fist to accentuate the point]


[Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: What are you doing to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

[Elaine has her head in her arms]

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE: Well, I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY: So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets a new guy! You bust that up! And then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world, he's boring.

ELAINE: I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY: Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman. Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. Jerry goes over, hits the button]

JERRY: Yeah.

DONNA: It's Donna Chang.

JERRY: Come on up.

[He opens the door a little]

ELAINE: Well, I guess I just didn't realize it.

JERRY: Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE: Okay.

JERRY: First, you encouraged her to join the army. She did.

ELAINE: She was lost.

JERRY: Then, you suggest she goes AWOL! She did!

ELAINE: Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.

JERRY: You know, you better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.

ELAINE: If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her and tell her to get back together with him, that's all!

[Donna Chang comes in briskly, in a good mood]

DONNA: Hi.

JERRY: Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine.

DONNA: Hello.

ELAINE: Hi! How are you?

DONNA: Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: Why? What happened?

DONNA: Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!

JERRY: Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA: Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!

ELAINE: Huh.

DONNA: She said you should come too.

JERRY: Tonight?

DONNA: Yeah, I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.

[She goes to the phone]

[Behind her, Jerry and Elaine slowly exchange looks]


[Same day. At the Costanza’s with Frank and Estelle. George bursts in, frantic. Estelle's snacking, watching TV]

GEORGE: Alright. Let me just say one thing, there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No way! Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!

ESTELLE: We're not getting divorced.

FRANK: Your mother changed her mind.

[He tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE: You did?! Thank God! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK: Yeah, we worked it out.

GEORGE: Alright. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK: He was my lawyer.

GEORGE: Your lawyer wears a cape?

FRANK: Yeah. So what?

GEORGE: Who wears a cape?

FRANK: He's very independent, he doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE: He looks ridiculous in that thing.

FRANK: You have no eye for fashion!!

ESTELLE: I have no eye for fashion?!

GEORGE: Alright! Come on! Let's not fight.

ESTELLE: Alright! Alright!

ESTELLE: Georgie's right.

[She pats him on the cheek]

GEORGE: Uh. So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE: It was that Chinese woman.

 
[In Jerry's car. Jerry's driving, Donna Chang is with him]

JERRY: So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA: I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY: Confucius, huh?

DONNA: Yeah.

JERRY: You know, you're not Chinese.


[At the Costanza’s house. Frank opens the door for Jerry and Donna]

JERRY: Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK: Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY: Elaine was in a rush.

FRANK: I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA: You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE: Yes. Who are you?

DONNA: I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE: You're not Chinese!

 
[In Noreen's apartment. Noreen and Kramer are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. Kramer picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between Elaine and them]

KRAMER: Hello?

ELAINE: Paul?

KRAMER: Elaine!

ELAINE: Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah!

ELAINE: What are you doing there?

KRAMER: Well, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE: Uh, is Noreen there?

KRAMER: Yes she is.

ELAINE: Well... can I talk to her?

KRAMER: Oh, what? Am I to boring for you?

ELAINE: Alright, would you just put her on?

KRAMER: Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.

ELAINE: You feel?

KRAMER: That's right! She and I have had a very long talk. And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years.

ELAINE: What, are you insane?!

KRAMER: From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here.

ELAINE: Uh! Ho ho. And what are you gonna tell her?

KRAMER: Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army. There she'll get the structure and the discipline she needs right now. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.

ELAINE: Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER: Can't help you kid.

ELAINE: Get the...

[Kramer puts the phone down]

 
[Back at the Costanza’s]

ESTELLE: You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA: No.

ESTELLE: I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA: I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE: Long Island?!?! I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA: I'm sorry?

ESTELLE: Well then, that changes everything!

GEORGE: What?!

ESTELLE: She's not Chinese. I was duped!!

GEORGE: So what?! She still gave you advice. What's the difference if she's not Chinese?!

ESTELLE: I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!!

[She goes into another room]

GEORGE: Wait a minute! You're, now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!

FRANK: You want a divorce?! You got one!!

JERRY: You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.


[Jerry and Elaine are walking down the street]

ELAINE: So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY: Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

[He buys a newspaper out of a machine]

ELAINE: You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY: Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.

[A cab pulls up and George gets out]

GEORGE: Oh, it had to happen!!

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: I knew it!

[He shuts the cab door]

GEORGE: I predicted it!

[He hits the cab roof twice, it drives off]

GEORGE: Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm running all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had lunch with my mother before. It's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[Kramer sticks his head out of the apartment window, shouts down to them]

KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's late!!

[He gives two thumbs up]
