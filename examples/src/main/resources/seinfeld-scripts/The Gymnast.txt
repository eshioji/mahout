[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.

GEORGE: I think she finds my stupidity charming.

JERRY: As we all do.

GEORGE: Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.

JERRY: Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?

GEORGE: Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.

JERRY: You're good with the mothers.

GEORGE: You know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.

JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.

GEORGE: Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something going.

JERRY: Oh, you got something going.

GEORGE: Yeah.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey!

[He heads toward the bathroom]

KRAMER: Hey, you got a hammer?

JERRY: What do you need a hammer for?

KRAMER: Well, I got this new poster. 3D art? Computers generate them.

JERRY: Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.

KRAMER: No no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?

JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.

KRAMER: George, you wanna go for a ride?

GEORGE: Nah.

KRAMER: Oh, come on!

JERRY: Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?

KRAMER: Alright, I've had it with you two.

[He opens apartment door to leave]

JERRY: Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?

KRAMER: A gymnast!

JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the eighty-four Olympics.

KRAMER: A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex will melt your face.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.

[Kramer shuts the door]

KRAMER: "Bailing"?

JERRY: Yeah, you know Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should pay that price.

JERRY: She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?

KRAMER: What?

[George returns from the bathroom buttoning his shirt]

GEORGE: A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.

JERRY: What is this?

GEORGE: What, I'm putting my shirt back on.

JERRY: "Back on"? What was it doing off?

GEORGE: I take it off when I go to the uh, you know, to the "office".

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.

JERRY: Unbuttoned, or all the way off?

GEORGE: All the way, baby!

JERRY: Of course.

[Kramer convulses in pain]

KRAMER: Yeow! Whoa.

JERRY: What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[He leaves]

JERRY: You always take the shirt off?

GEORGE: Always.

JERRY: Boy, I tell you, knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next and I'm real scared.

 
[At Mr. Pitt's office]

MRPITT: Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.

ELAINE: What meeting?

MRPITT: I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.

ELAINE: Oh!

[She tries to take the paper]

MRPITT: Are you using a fountain pen?

ELAINE: Yes?

MRPITT: They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.

ELAINE: Alright! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.

[Knock at door]

KRAMER: Elaine?

ELAINE: Come in, come in!

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He enters and points at a package]

KRAMER: Yeah, huh?

ELAINE: Ah, right there, yeah.

[He rips open the package]

KRAMER: Yeah, that's...

ELAINE: Kramer, it's...

[He hold up the framed picture]

KRAMER: There she blows!

[He throws the paper around]

ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?

KRAMER: Oh, these are nice corners, huh?

MRPITT: Elaine, did I hear...

[He sees Kramer]

MRPITT: Oh, this is very odd.

KRAMER: Yeah, its 3D art. Computers generate them. Big computers.

MRPITT: Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?

KRAMER: Well, you blur your eyes like you're staring straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...

[Kramer and Pitt stare at picture]

KRAMER: Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

MRPITT: I don't see it.

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...

MRPITT: I still don't see it.

ELAINE: Okay Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.

KRAMER: You ever dream in three D? It's like the boogeyman is coming right at you.

MRPITT: A spaceship, where?

KRAMER: Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused.

[He convulses in pain]

KRAMER: Ah! Oh, mama!

ELAINE: Kramer, what's wrong?

KRAMER: Mama!

ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?

KRAMER: I think I gotta go to the doctor! Oh, mama!

[He leaves]

MRPITT: How long does it usually take?

 
[At Lindsay's mother's apartment]

[Lindsay's relatives are laughing and George has apparently been witty and charming]

MRSENRIGHT: Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.

LINDSAY: Mother.

GEORGE: Oh, no no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.

MRSENRIGHT: Oh? Are you and your family close?

GEORGE: Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.

LINDSAY: Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?

GEORGE: Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait!

[He shakes hands with Nana]

GEORGE: Nana, nice to see you. Nana!

[He embraces another guest]

GEORGE: Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?

MRSENRIGHT: Can I offer you anything to eat?

GEORGE: Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?

MRSENRIGHT: Oh no George, you don't have to.

GEORGE: No, I know I don't have to, I want to.

MRSENRIGHT: George, you are such a gentleman.

GEORGE: I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. Here we go, alright.

 
[In the kitchen]

[George opens the trash bin and sees an eclair at the top with one bite taken out of it. After looking around to make sure no one is watching, he picks up the eclair and takes a bite just as Mrs. Enright enters the kitchen]

MRSENRIGHT: Oh.

[She leaves]

[George spits out the eclair]

GEORGE: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
 
[He takes off after her]


[At Mr. Pitt's office]

[Elaine is looking at the 3D picture with Mr. Pitt]

ELAINE: Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!

MRPITT: Where is it?

[She points]

ELAINE: Right here.

MRPITT: I'm looking there!

ELAINE: No no, unfocus.

MRPITT: I am unfocused!

[The phone rings]

ELAINE: Hello? Oh yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.

MRPITT: Meeting?

ELAINE: Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?

MRPITT: Why don't you go for me?

ELAINE: How can I go?

MRPITT: Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.

MRPITT: Oh, damn this thing!

 
[In Jerry's car]

JERRY: So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.

KATYA: Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.

JERRY: He uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"

KATYA: And you could not refuse.

JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.

KATYA: He was a very bad dictator.

JERRY: Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
 

[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: So let me get this straight. You find yourself in the kitchen. You see an eclair in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."

GEORGE: No no no no no. It was not trash!

JERRY: Was it in the trash?

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: Then it was trash.

GEORGE: It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.

JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!

GEORGE: Above the rim.

JERRY: Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.

GEORGE: It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.

JERRY: Was it eaten?

GEORGE: One little bite.

JERRY: Well, that's garbage.

GEORGE: But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!

JERRY: Well, you my friend have crossed the line that divides man and bum. You are now a bum.

[Kramer enters, walking awkwardly]

JERRY: Hey!

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: I got a stone.

JERRY: What stone?

KRAMER: A kidney stone.

JERRY: What is that, anyway?

KRAMER: It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the urethra into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!

JERRY: Oh, that's gotta hurt.

 
[At the Poland Creek office]

ARONSON: Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.

ELAINE: Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock.

[She giggles]

BECK: And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full scale production by the spring.

ELAINE: Alright. Hey you guys, what's the name of the new company gonna be?

BECK: Moland Spring.

[Elaine makes a face]

ELAINE: "Moland"?

ARONSON: Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.

ELAINE: Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".

ARONSON: But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.

ELAINE: Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?

ARONSON: We've got to do something about that name.
 

[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is on the phone]

GEORGE: No Lindsay, it was not in the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering, like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time.

[Jerry makes a face]

GEORGE: It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Bye bye.

[He hangs up the phone]

GEORGE: I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.

JERRY: Good for you.

GEORGE: Yes, good for me!

JERRY: You know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.

GEORGE: Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers. I will go to the florist!

[Kramer enters holding a video tape]

KRAMER: Behold! The Games of the eighty-four Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance!

[He inserts the tape into VCR]

JERRY: Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.

KRAMER: Jerry, what is your problem?

JERRY: Kramer, you know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.

KRAMER: Alright Jerry, are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Tantric yoga?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!

JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. I guess that's better than eating it.

KRAMER: Alright, alright, why don't we just watch the tape?

[He starts the tape]

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: Did you pass your stone yet?

KRAMER: Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.

[Jerry points at the TV]

JERRY: Hey, that's her!

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.

[Feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape]

KRAMER: Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse Hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing!

[He gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape] 
KRAMER: Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape?

[Silence]

KRAMER: I'll take that as a yes.
 

[In Jerry's car at night]

JERRY: Well, here we are.

KATYA: Yes. We are here.

JERRY: How did you stay on that beam like that? I mean, it's only this wide!

KATYA: I can balance myself in any position.

[Jerry swallows]

KATYA: It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.

JERRY: Oh boy.

 
[At Jerry's apartment, morning]

JERRY: I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.

ELAINE: Well, what did you think she was gonna do?

JERRY: Well, you know. I mean... I don't know.

ELAINE: No, what?

JERRY: Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...

ELAINE: What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...

JERRY: You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...

ELAINE: Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?

JERRY: Well... frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kind of be like the apparatus.

KRAMER: You mean like the uneven parallel bars?

JERRY: See, again, I really don't feel that...

ELAINE: The balance beam?

JERRY: Could we stop?

ELAINE: Not the pommel horse?

JERRY: Alright. Let's just drop it.

[Jerry and Elaine move to couch]

JERRY: So let me ask you this. How long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.

ELAINE: I don't know, at least three weeks.

JERRY: Oh great.

ELAINE: Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.

JERRY: Between Poland and Morgan?

ELAINE: Yeah. Started a big name controversy.

[Kramer shouts from off-screen]

JERRY: Kramer! The stone!

[Jerry and Elaine rush to Kramer's apartment and stand in doorway]

JERRY: What happened, did you pass the stone?

KRAMER: No, I tried to do a reverse Hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.

 
[On a city street]

[George is exiting the florist with a bouquet of flowers and a cup of coffee]

GEORGE: "...tootsie, good bye. Too too, tootsie..."

[He takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop]

GEORGE: You call this coffee?

[He dumps out the coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield]

MANINCAR: Hey! What the hell was that?!

GEORGE: I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I, I...

MANINCAR: Clean that up!

GEORGE: Oh, sure. Of course.

[He looks for place to set down the flowers]

GEORGE: Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. 
[He grabs some newspapers from a trash bin and begins wiping the windshield] 
GEORGE: Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.

[Mrs. Enright sees George cleaning car windshield and looks appalled]

GEORGE: Look at this sparkle.

[He looks up and sees Lindsay's mother]

GEORGE: Mrs. Enright!

[He runs after her]

GEORGE: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!

 
[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is on the phone again]

GEORGE: No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye bye.

[He hangs up]

JERRY: Strike two!

GEORGE: You think I'm going down?

JERRY: You're behind in the count.

GEORGE: I know.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey, what are you doing later?

JERRY: I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.

KRAMER: Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time. People are a little shy, a little reticent.

JERRY: If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.

KRAMER: Alright, where you going?

JERRY: We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.

KRAMER: Well Jerry, it's your obligation. Come on.

JERRY: Yeah, well, you know what? If I gotta go and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!

KRAMER: No no no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.

JERRY: Yeah, well you're going.

KRAMER: Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
 

[At Mr. Pitt's office]

[He's in a polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots]

MRPITT: I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.

ELAINE: Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?

MRPITT: I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!

ELAINE: Well, I'm so sorry! I...

MRPITT: Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting.

[The phone rings]

MRPITT: Elaine?

ELAINE: Oh, sorry.

[He picks up the phone]

ELAINE: Hello?

[Mr. Pitt walks by the 3D poster and stops]

MRPITT: Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!

 
[At the circus, backstage]

[Clowns rush by Jerry and Kramer, Kramer flinches in fear]

KATYA: So Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?

JERRY: Greatest Show on Earth!

KATYA: My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.

JERRY: Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.

[Katya's friend walks up]

KATYA: Ah, Misha!

MISHA: Katya!

KATYA: Misha, this is Jerry.

MISHA: Ah, yes. The "comedian", eh?

[He speaks in Romanian to Katya]

[She laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry]

 
[At Mr. Pitt's office]

[Elaine is on the phone]

ELAINE: Oh yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um, hold on. Mr. Pitt!

[Mr. Pitt is staring at the poster]

MRPITT: I think I'm on to something!

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!

MRPITT: You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want deep focus!

ELAINE: Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Let me just... 
[She reaches into her purse]

ELAINE: Yeah, I've got it.

[She pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink]

ELAINE: Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there.

[She drops the phone and rushes to Mr. Pitt]

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop staring at that poster!

MRPITT: I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?

[Elaine grabs the poster and smashes it]

ELAINE: No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it!

[He grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket]

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!

MRPITT: Hmm, what's happened to me?

[He straightens his lapels]

MRPITT: When's the meeting?

ELAINE: In about twenty minutes.

MRPITT: Oh!

[He puts a finger to his face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an "Adolph Hitler" style moustache]

MRPITT: Do I have time to change?

ELAINE: Um, no.

MRPITT: Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.

ELAINE: Uh, Mr. Pitt.

MRPITT: Yes?

ELAINE: Um, there's just a...

[She points at her own upper lip]

[He sees her hands covered in ink]

MRPITT: Is that ink?

ELAINE: No?

[Mr. Pitt leaves]

 
[In George's car]

GEORGE: Well, here we are.

LINDSAY: Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.

GEORGE: Maybe I could just use the bathroom.

LINDSAY: Sure.

 
[At the Circus, back stage]

[The circus announcer can be heard, "Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb."]

MISHA: It is time.

JERRY: Well, break a leg.

[Misha gives Jerry a dark look]

JERRY: Eh, show biz.

[The circus announcer can be heard, "Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!"]

[Misha leaves]

JERRY: Boy, those capes are really coming back.

 
[At Lindsay's mother's apartment]

[A man exits the bathroom]

PARTYGUEST: Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those three D art posters in there.

[He wipes his eyes]

PARTYGUEST: It's mesmerizing.

[George enters the bathroom]

 
[At the circus]

[Kramer repeatedly convulses in pain, spilling popcorn and food everywhere. He enters the men's room]

[Misha walks slowly across tightrope]

[A long scream bellows forth from men's room, causing the other occupant to flee and Misha to wobble]

 
[Circus, back stage]

JERRY: What is that sound?

[Katya covers her ears]

KATYA: It is horrible!

[Shots of various circus performers reacting to the reverberating scream. Misha falls off the tightrope as audience gasps in horror]

 
[At Lindsay's mother's apartment]

[George emerges from bathroom, shirtless and rubbing his eyes]

GEORGE: Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!

[George looks around and sees all the party guests staring at him, then realizes he's shirtless. He tries to act casual]

 
[At the Morgan Springs shareholder meeting]

[Mr. Pitt stands at a podium. He still has the small black "ink moustache". He speaks harshly and with conviction, gesturing emphatically]

MRPITT: I have been accused of wrong doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We will annex Poland by the spring, at any cost! And our stock will rise high!

[He raises his hand similar to a Nazi salute]

 
[At the circus, back stage]

KATYA: He'll be alright. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.

JERRY: Oh, why not?

KATYA: It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.

JERRY: Really?

KATYA: In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the "Comedian". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no comedian.

[She walks off]


[Circus, men's room]

[Kramer walks out, jubilant and whistling]
