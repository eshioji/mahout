[At the Improv bar]

GEORGE: What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I wonder what toilet paper was like in the eighteen sixties. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?

JERRY: Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?

GEORGE: Alright, then what did they do?

JERRY: I don't know. Maybe they gave out big loose clumps to all the soldiers.

GEORGE: Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.

JERRY: Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper during the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack.

[Two men approach Jerry]

STU: Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm from NBC.

JERRY: Hello.

STU: Could we speak for a few moments?

JERRY: Sure, sure.

JAY: Hi, Jay Crespi.

JERRY: Hello.

GEORGE: Uh, C R E S P I.

JAY: That's right.

GEORGE: I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me your last name.

JAY: Uh, I'm not...

JERRY: George.

GEORGE: Huh? Alright, fine.

STU: First of all, that was a terrific show.

JERRY: Oh, thank you very much.

STU: And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.

JERRY: Really? Wow.

STU: So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, we'd just love to talk about it.

JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that.

STU: Well here, uh...

[He hands Jerry his business card]

STU: Why don't you give us a call and maybe we can uh, develop a series.

JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.

STU: It was very nice meeting you.

JERRY: Thank you.

JAY: Nice meeting you.

JERRY: Nice meeting you.

[They leave]

[George returns]

GEORGE: What was that all about?

JERRY: They said they were interested in me.

GEORGE: For what?

JERRY: You know, a TV show.

GEORGE: Your own show?

JERRY: Yeah, I guess so.

GEORGE: They want you to do a TV show?

JERRY: Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.

GEORGE: Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. Alright, you want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach a gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son is not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.

JERRY: Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?

GEORGE: Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.

JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody.

GEORGE: I know, but he's your son.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: Alright, forget that idea, it's not for you. Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.

JERRY: Yeah, and?

GEORGE: And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.

JERRY: What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and suddenly I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.

GEORGE: But antiques are very popular right now.

JERRY: No they're not, they used to be.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, like you know.

JERRY: Oh, like you do.


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: ...and you're the manager of the circus.

JERRY: A circus?

KRAMER: Come on, this is a great idea. I mean, look at the characters. You've got all these freaks in the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've got the tallest man in the world, a guy who's just a head.

JERRY: I don't think so.

KRAMER: Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.

JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.

KRAMER: Why not?

JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks!

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong! People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."

[Newman enters]

NEWMAN: Kramer.

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: Come on let's go I got the helmet. Go get the radar detector.

KRAMER: Alright, okay I'll be back in a second. Hey, you guys coming to my party?

JERRY: Yeah.

NEWMAN: Yeah, sure.

[Kramer leaves]

JERRY: What is this all about?

NEWMAN: Ah, we're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet and he's giving me his uh, radar detector.

JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorcycle.

NEWMAN: Well my girlfriend had one.

JERRY: You have a girlfriend?

NEWMAN: I had a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.

JERRY: I don't remember you with a girl.

NEWMAN: Nevertheless...

JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.

NEWMAN: Don't say anything.

JERRY: Alright.

[Kramer enters]

JERRY: Hey you know you're getting gypped over here.

KRAMER: Really, huh.

NEWMAN: We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.

KRAMER: Oh, stop saying reneging.

NEWMAN: Well you're reneging.

KRAMER: I, okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

NEWMAN: Alright. Give it.

[They try to exchange items but neither one of them will let go]

NEWMAN: Alright give it to me, let go.

KRAMER: You let go, come on...

[They fight over the items]

JERRY: Give me that, just give me that!

[Jerry takes the helmet and radar detector from them and exchanges them]

KRAMER: Your going to break it.

JERRY: Here. Idiots!

NEWMAN: Thanks buddy. So long.

[Newman laughs as he exits]

[Kramer puts on the helmet]

JERRY: Does that thing work?

KRAMER: Nah.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Jerry and George enter]

JERRY: Did I tell you I got a postcard from Elaine?

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.

GEORGE: I can't believe she got involved with a shrink. So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?

JERRY: No, nothing.

GEORGE: Why don't they have salsa on the table?

JERRY: What do you need salsa for?

GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.

JERRY: Do you know why? Because people like to say, "Salsa." "Excuse me, do you have any salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"

GEORGE: You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. "I wanted seltzer, not salsa!"

JERRY: "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa? You have the seltzer after the salsa!"

GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: This. Just talking.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.

JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about?

GEORGE: It's about nothing.

JERRY: No story?

GEORGE: No forget the story.

JERRY: You've got to have a story.

GEORGE: Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.

JERRY: And who's on the show? Who are the characters?

GEORGE: I could be a character.

JERRY: You?

GEORGE: Yeah. You base a character on me.

JERRY: So, on the show there's a character named George Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah. What, there's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."

JERRY: And who else is on the show?

GEORGE: Elaine could be a character. Kramer!

JERRY: Now he's a character. So everybody I know is a character on the show.

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And it's about nothing?

GEORGE: Absolutely nothing.

JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.

GEORGE: We go into NBC.

JERRY: "We?" Since when are you a writer?

GEORGE: Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.

JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC?

GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here.

JERRY: What do we got?

GEORGE: An idea.

JERRY: What idea?

GEORGE: An idea for the show.

JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is!

GEORGE: It's about nothing!

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.

JERRY: So we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.

GEORGE: Exactly.

JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."

GEORGE: There you go.

[A moment passes]

[Jerry nods]

JERRY: I think you may have something here.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry's explaining George's idea to Kramer]

JERRY: So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.

KRAMER: No, I don't think so.

JERRY: What do you mean you don't think so?

KRAMER: I don't like it.

JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?

KRAMER: I don't like the idea of a character based on me.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Well it just doesn't sit well.

JERRY: You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.

KRAMER: That's your problem, buddy.

JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.

KRAMER: Hey, I'll tell you what, you can do it on one condition.

JERRY: Whatever you want.

KRAMER: I get to play Kramer.

JERRY: You can't play Kramer.

KRAMER: I am Kramer.

JERRY: But you can't act.

KRAMER: Phew!

[Newman enters]

JERRY: Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.

KRAMER: Newman?

NEWMAN: Use me for what?

JERRY: Nothing. What do you want?

NEWMAN: Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving home on the Palisades Parkway...

[Jerry and Kramer turn away]

NEWMAN: ...when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on but I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?

KRAMER: Yeah. That's strange.

NEWMAN: Because a radar detector, as I understand it, detects radar! With a series of beeps and flashing lights! But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren!

KRAMER: That's queer.

[Newman jumps in Kramer's face]

NEWMAN: I want my helmet back! You give me my helmet back and you're going to pay for that ticket!

KRAMER: Yeah, you better think again mujombo.

NEWMAN: You gave me a defective detector! Jerry?

[Jerry puts his hands up]

JERRY: Buyer beware.

NEWMAN: Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?

KRAMER: No. We had a deal. There's no guarantees in life.

NEWMAN: No, but there's karma, Kramer.

JERRY: Karma Kramer?

NEWMAN: And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party.

[Newman leaves]


[In the NBC reception area]

[Jerry and George are waiting]

JERRY: Salsa, seltzer. Excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not seltzer, salsa.

[George doesn't react]

JERRY: What's the matter?

[George is nervous]

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: You sure? You look a little pale.

GEORGE: No, fine, good, fine, very good.

JERRY: What, are you nervous?

GEORGE: No, not nervous. I'm good, I'm very good.

[A beat, then he snaps]

GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do this!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.

JERRY: This was your idea!

GEORGE: What idea? I just said something!

[He smacks Jerry]

GEORGE: I didn't know you were going to listen to me!

JERRY: Don't worry about it. They're just TV executives.

GEORGE: They're men with jobs Jerry! They wear suits and ties! They're married, they have secretaries!

JERRY: I told you not to come.

GEORGE: I need some water. I gotta get some water.

JERRY: They'll give us water in there.

GEORGE: Really? That's pretty good.

[Jerry looks into hallway and sees a man standing there]

JERRY: Oh God, its Joe Davola.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: It's this guy he's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.

[The man turns around and sees Jerry]

JERRY: Oh God he saw me.

[Davola walks in]

DAVOLA: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Joe! How you doing?

[Jerry stands up and holds out his hand to shake]

DAVOLA: You're under no obligation to shake my hand.

JERRY: Oh no, just a custom. That's uh, my friend George. You look good.

DAVOLA: Why shouldn't I look good?

JERRY: Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?

DAVOLA: You want to hit me?

JERRY: What are you doing here?

DAVOLA: I dropped a script off.

JERRY: Oh, good for you.

[They stare at each other for a few seconds]

JERRY: Well...

DAVOLA: You don't have to say anything.

JERRY: No uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

DAVOLA: Why?

JERRY: Kramer's party.

DAVOLA: Kramer's... having a party?

JERRY: No no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

[Davola puts his hand to his head like he's getting a headache]

DAVOLA: Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.

JERRY: No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.

[Davola leaves]

JERRY: Give my best to Hinckley.

GEORGE: What was that?

JERRY: I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him. I gotta call Kramer.

[Before he can dial a lady enters]

NBCRECEPTIONIST: They're ready for you.

GEORGE: Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?

JERRY: Relax. Who are they?

GEORGE: Yeah, they're not better than me.

JERRY: Course not.

GEORGE: Who are they?

JERRY: They're nobody.

GEORGE: What about me?

JERRY: What about you?

GEORGE: Why them? Why not me?

JERRY: Why not you?

GEORGE: I'm just as good as them.

JERRY: Better.

GEORGE: You really think so?

JERRY: No.

[The door opens and from Jerry and George's point of view four executives stand up. Jerry and George look at each other]


[In the NBC president's office]

[Stu Chermak, Susan Ross, Jay Crespi, and Russell Dalrimple, the head of the network, are all talking with Jerry and George]

[Stu is laughing]

STU: The bit, the bit I really liked was were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.

[George is laughing]

GEORGE: The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.

JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

RUSSELL: What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?

[George quickly makes something up]

GEORGE: Well, possibly. I uh, I, I wrote an off Broadway uh, show uh, "La Cocina." Actually, it was off off uh, Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.

JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one uh, great scene with, with the chef um, what was his name?

GEORGE: Pepe.

JERRY: Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And uh, he was making tamales.

SUSAN: Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

GEORGE: Uh no, no he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.

RUSSELL: So, what have you two come up with?

JERRY: Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself...

[George interrupts]

GEORGE: May I?

JERRY: Oh, go ahead.

GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word.

[He points with both index fingers]

GEORGE: Nothing.

RUSSELL: Nothing?

GEORGE: Nothing.

RUSSELL: What does that mean?

GEORGE: The show is about nothing.

JERRY: Well, it's not about nothing.

GEORGE: No, it's about nothing.

JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.

[Jerry and George glare at each other. The receptionist enters]

NBCRECEPTIONIST: Mr. Dalrimple, your niece is on the phone.

RUSSELL: I'll call back.

[The receptionist leaves]

[George attempts to spell his last name]

GEORGE: D A L R I M P E L?

RUSSELL: Not even close.

GEORGE: Is that with a Y?

RUSSELL: No.

SUSAN: What's the premise?

JERRY: Well, as I was saying, I, I would play myself and uh, as a comedian living in New York and I have a friend and a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.

GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read, you eat, you read, you go shopping.

RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?

JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading. We didn't discuss the reading.

RUSSELL: Alright, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?

GEORGE: Oh no, no stories.

RUSSELL: No stories? So what is it?

GEORGE: What did you do today?

RUSSELL: I got up and came to work.

GEORGE: There's a show. That's a show.

RUSSELL: How is that a show?

JERRY: Well uh, maybe, maybe something happens on the way to work.

GEORGE: No no no, nothing happens.

JERRY: Well, something happens.

RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?

GEORGE: Because it's on TV.

RUSSELL: Not yet.

GEORGE: Okay uh, look. If you want to just keep on doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one...

[He gets up to leave]

GEORGE: ...am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else.
[He points]

GEORGE: This is the show and we're not going to change it.

[He snaps his fingers] 
GEORGE: [To Jerry] Right?

[George leaves]

[A moment passes]

JERRY: How about this. I manage a circus...


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.

GEORGE: I thought the woman was kind of cute.

JERRY: Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?

GEORGE: Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.

JERRY: It's completely inappropriate!

GEORGE: Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. We had good eye contact the whole meeting.

JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.

GEORGE: Well, wait a minute let me call Susan.

JERRY: No, no this is more important.

GEORGE: She might be leaving to work any minute.

JERRY: No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Davola about his party.

GEORGE: No.

[They race to the phone and fight over it] 


[In a Paris hotel room. Dr. Reston and Elaine are kissing. He stops and looks off in the distance]

ELAINE: What is it?

DRRESTON: I was just thinking about this patient of mine.

ELAINE: What?

DRRESTON: Just wondering if he's taking his medication.

ELAINE: Ah, come on, we're on vacation.

[They go back to kissing each other]


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Well we were standing there in the waiting area there and you know how Davola is. He's all...
 
[The intercom buzzes]

[Kramer goes over to answer it]

KRAMER: [On the intercom] Yeah.

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: And so uh, I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.

[Kramer puts up his hand]

KRAMER: Whoa whoa, back up a second.

JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.

KRAMER: Why would you think I would invite him?

JERRY: Well, I just assumed...

KRAMER: Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.

[George and Susan enter]

GEORGE: Hello, oh hello. You remember Susan from NBC?

JERRY: Of course. How are you?

SUSAN: Fine, it's good to see you.

GEORGE: And this is Kramer.

SUSAN: Hello.

GEORGE: Alright go ahead Susan, tell him.

JERRY: Tell me what?

SUSAN: Well, I...

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Uh, sorry, excuse me one second. [Answers the phone] Hello?

[Voice on phone can be heard, "Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service?"]

JERRY: Oh gee, I, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.

[Voice on phone can be head, "Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that."]

JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.

[Voice on phone can be head, "No."]

JERRY: Well now you know how I feel.

[Jerry slams down the phone]

GEORGE: Well, go ahead, tell him.

SUSAN: Well...

JERRY: Kramer, are you drinking that milk?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: What's the expiration date on that?

[Kramer looks at the milk container]

KRAMER: September third.

JERRY: The third?

GEORGE: The third?

SUSAN: The third?

[Kramer starts convulsing]

KRAMER: Um, Uh, ugh...

[He staggers forward a little bit, then turns around to make a run for the kitchen sink but Susan stands in the way]

SUSAN: Ah!

[Kramer throws up on Susan]


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.

JERRY: I think she saw it coming.

GEORGE: You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bringing her up there to tell you. And she liked me.

JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.

GEORGE: What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.

JERRY: Vomiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain, Chamberlain still would have given him Czechoslovakia.

GEORGE: Chamberlain, you could hold his head in the toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.

[Kramer enters with a helmet]

JERRY: What happened to you?

KRAMER: Davola came after me.

JERRY: What? Davola? [To George] See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?

KRAMER: Can I have a coffee. What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know, because I had to get a new strap. 
[We see the helmet has a big dent in it]

KRAMER: So I had it on you know.

[He puts the helmet on]

KRAMER: And I was checking the strap out to make sure that it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head.

[He puts his hand to the side of his head]

KRAMER: It knocks me down.

[He pushes his head down on the table]

KRAMER: I look up and it's Crazy Joe Davola. And he says, "That's what I think of your party."

[Kramer takes off the helmet and Jerry looks at it]

JERRY: Boy that is some kick.

KRAMER: Well yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.

JERRY: Wow, Newman's helmet.

GEORGE: Holy.

KRAMER: I got bad news for you buddy. Davola says you're next.

JERRY: Me, why?

KRAMER: He doesn't like you.

JERRY: What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.

KRAMER: Pass the creamer.

GEORGE: Wait a second.

[He takes the creamer and smells it]

GEORGE: Alright.

[George gives the creamer to Kramer]
