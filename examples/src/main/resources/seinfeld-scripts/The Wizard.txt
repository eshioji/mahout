[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page turner? 

[He sees Jerry with a small black device]

GEORGE: What's that?

JERRY: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm going to Florida for his birthday.

GEORGE: How much was it?

JERRY: Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.

GEORGE: Where are you getting a Wizard for fifty dollars?

JERRY: Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.

GEORGE: I got a message from the Rosses at work today.

JERRY: Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?

GEORGE: At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kind of felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.

JERRY: Why, because you picked out the poison envelopes? That's silly.

[Elaine enters with her boyfriend]

ELAINE: Oh um, Darryl, these are... people I know. Jerry, George.

DARYL: Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run Elaine. I'll see you later.

ELAINE: Okay.

JERRY: Still no Puddy?

ELAINE: Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?

JERRY: What? About you dating a black guy? What's the big deal?

ELAINE: What black guy?

JERRY: Darryl. He's black, isn't he?

ELAINE: He is?

GEORGE: No, he isn't.

JERRY: Isn't he, Elaine?

ELAINE: You think?

GEORGE: I thought he looked Irish.

JERRY: What's his last name?

ELAINE: Nelson.

GEORGE: That's not Irish.

JERRY: I think he's black.

GEORGE: Should we be talking about this?

ELAINE: I think it's okay.

GEORGE: No, it isn't.

JERRY: Why not?

GEORGE: Well, it would be okay if Darryl was here.

JERRY: If he's black.

ELAINE: Is he black?

JERRY: Does it matter?

ELAINE: No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.

JERRY: Oh, so you need to know?

ELAINE: No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.

[A black waitress approaches the table]

BLACKWAITRESS: Should I take that?

JERRY: Uh, one second.

ELAINE: Oh, here.

GEORGE: Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.

[They all leave a lot of money on the table for the waitress]


[At Jerry's apartment. George is on the phone]

GEORGE: Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's, it's George.

MRSROSS: Uh, who?

GEORGE: George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.

MRROSS: We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.

MRSROSS: Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.

GEORGE: Oh, I just uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.

MRROSS: I'm going back to bed.

MRSROSS: Thank you for calling, George.

GEORGE: Oh, sure. I mean after all, you were almost my uh... okay, I gotta go.

[He hangs up]

JERRY: House in the Hamptons?

GEORGE: Well, you know I've been lying about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Well.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Well, grab a cigar boys. Yeah, it's time to celebrate.

JERRY: Wow. What are we celebrating?

KRAMER: Uh, you remember my coffee table book?

JERRY: With the little legs?

KRAMER: That's the one. A big Hollywood so and so optioned it for a movie.

GEORGE: How are they gonna make that book into a movie?

KRAMER: You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?

GEORGE: Yeah?

KRAMER: Independence Day?

GEORGE: Oh.

JERRY: How much are they paying you?

KRAMER: Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.

JERRY: That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.

KRAMER: Yeah, and you're not going to because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.

JERRY: From what?

KRAMER: From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.

JERRY: What's that?

KRAMER: Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.

JERRY: Oh!

GEORGE: Oh!

KRAMER: Well, it's not really gold.

JERRY: Aw.

GEORGE: Aw.


[At Darryl's apartment]

[Elaine approaches Darryl's apartment and hears loud rap music being played. She smiles knowingly]

[Daryl opens his door]

ELAINE: Hey.

DARYL: Hey.

ELAINE: Great music.

DARYL: Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty-four hours a day. I hate it.

[Daryl bangs on the wall]

DARYL: Yo yo, turn it down!

[Elaine notices some African art on the wall]

ELAINE: Oh wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?

DARYL: They're... African.

ELAINE: Right. African.

DARYL: Well, not Africa actually. South Africa.

ELAINE: South Africa.

DARYL: My family used to live there, but uh, we got out years ago for obvious reasons. You know how it is.

ELAINE: Maybe.


[On the street. George is talking to a hot dog vender]

GEORGE: You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else you uh, you really like them and that's why you, you do this.

[The Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street and observe George not being in the Hamptons and move on]

GEORGE: I'll tell you, if I had one of these things, I'd be eating hot dogs all the time.

VENDER: Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?

GEORGE: Mmm, no.


[In Florida at the Seinfeld condo]

[Jerry comes out of the room after just waking up]

MORTY: Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!

JERRY: It's five-thirty in the morning!

HELEN: We let you sleep in.

JERRY: Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here.

[He hands Morty a gift]

JERRY: Happy birthday.

MORTY: Aw Jerry, I should be buying you presents.

JERRY: What does that mean?

HELEN: Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.

MORTY: Oh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.

JERRY: Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.

MORTY: This looks like too much money.

JERRY: Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was like, fifty bucks.

MORTY: You think it's hot?

JERRY: Could be.

MORTY: Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!

HELEN: I'm right here.

JERRY: And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.

MORTY: So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?

JERRY: Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.

MORTY: Helen, we can go into restaurants and figure out the tips.

HELEN: Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.

[Kramer enters through the front door. He goes to the fridge and gets some cookies]

KRAMER: Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?

JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here?

KRAMER: I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.

HELEN: Mr. Kornstein died and it's a beautiful apartment.

KRAMER: Yeah, your uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.

JERRY: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.

[Morty and Helen turn and look at Jerry]

JERRY: Not you. Older people.

HELEN: Don't eat cookies for breakfast!

[She takes the cookies away from Kramer]

HELEN: I'll fix you something. How about a feta cheese omelet?

KRAMER: Mmm, that sounds great, Mom.

JERRY: If you feed him he'll never leave.

HELEN: We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?

KRAMER: I guess.

JERRY: I can't believe this.

KRAMER: I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?


[At Monk's Cafe]

ELAINE: So George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?

GEORGE: Actually, I did have a thought.

ELAINE: Oh.

GEORGE: Why don't you just ask him?

ELAINE: Because if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.

GEORGE: Maybe he's um... mixed.

ELAINE: Is that the right word?

GEORGE: I really don't think we're supposed to be talking about this.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

ELAINE: You know what, I'm leaving.

GEORGE: Yeah.

ELAINE: I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back.

[The Rosses enter]

ELAINE: Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.

MRSROSS: Oh, you're George's friend.

MRROSS: We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?

[Elaine laughs uproariously]

ELAINE: The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.

[George comes out of the bathroom and sees the Rosses]

GEORGE: Rosses.

MRROSS: George, we were just talking about you.

GEORGE: Well, sorry I missed that uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.

MRSROSS: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, I may move out there.

[He gets the "yeah, right" glances from the Rosses]

GEORGE: I mean it, I'll do it! Okay, I'll see you later. Keep it real!


[In Florida at a restaurant]

MORTY: Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.

JERRY: Dad, it's got lots of other functions.

MORTY: Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions.

[He tries to open it]

MORTY: I can't get it open.

[Jerry easily opens it]

HELEN: Yay! Jerry got it open.

MORTY: The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does twelve point four percent sound?

JERRY: Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.

MORTY: We'll round down.

HELEN: Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.

JERRY: Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.

MORTY: I was never impeached! I resigned!

HELEN: Even so, the press would bury him!

JERRY: What press?

HELEN: The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.

MORTY: Pinko commie rag.


[In Florida at the clubhouse. Sid approaches Morty and Kramer]

SID: Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.

JERRY: She's fifty.

SID: You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.

KRAMER: Alright, I'll see you guys.

SID: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[Kramer get up to leave and see Morty standing right next to him staring at his face. He taps on Morty's glasses]

KRAMER: Morty, what're you looking at?

MORTY: I'll tell you what I'm looking at. The next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.

KRAMER: Hmm.


[At Darryl's apartment]

DARYL: Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!

[Elaine laughs somewhat awkwardly]

DARYL: Wow, it's got so many functions.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First things is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...

DARYL: Well, I don't do that stuff.

ELAINE: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one, race.

DARYL: Isn't that optional?

ELAINE: It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.

DARYL: Alright, I'm... Asian.

ELAINE: What?

DARYL: Just to mess with them.

ELAINE: Oh. Right. Good one.

DARYL: Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.

ELAINE: Really?

DARYL: Does that matter?

ELAINE: No, but... it is very nice to know.


[In Florida at the Seinfeld condo. Jerry is talking to Elaine on the phone]

JERRY: So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.

ELAINE: Ah, I've given up. So now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.

JERRY: You're a master of race relations.

ELAINE: Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?

JERRY: Yeah, it's all my father's doing.

[Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry to hand him a magazine from the table]

JERRY: He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.

ELAINE: Oh, who are they running against?

JERRY: Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.

[George enters Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Jerry?

ELAINE: He's still down with his folks.

GEORGE: What are you doing here?

JERRY: Elaine? Elaine?

ELAINE: I'm getting his mail.

JERRY: Oh no.

GEORGE: He asked you to get the mail?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

[George takes the phone from Elaine] 

GEORGE: Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?

JERRY: George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: What about the mail?

JERRY: This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.

GEORGE: Alright, Jerry. I'll do it. See you.

[He hangs up]


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: So, I ran into the Rosses again.

ELAINE: Oh right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?

GEORGE: From me.

ELAINE: What did you say?

GEORGE: I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?

ELAINE: I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.

GEORGE: So, they knew? Those liars!

ELAINE: But you lied first.

GEORGE: Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!

ELAINE: Like you're a liar!

GEORGE: Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?

ELAINE: So, this is over, not over? I'm betting not over.

GEORGE: Mmm hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.

ELAINE: Haven't you done enough to these people?

GEORGE: This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.

[Elaine gets a sarcastic "oh boy" expression]


[In Florida. Kramer is campaigning]

[A newspaper flashes on the screen, "Kramer Ahead In The Polls"]

[A woman pushes her baby stroller up to Kramer. He bends down and touches the babies cheek. Then a woman pushes a old man in a wheelchair up to Kramer. He does the same thing to him as he did with the baby]

[Another paper flashes on the screen, "Kramer: I Will Increase Social Security"]

[Kramer puts a "Vote Kramer" bumper sticker on an ambulance. He then knocks twice on the door and it pulls away revealing a group of people clapping for him]

[Another paper flashes on the screen, "Vacancy In Building Four"]


[At Monk's Cafe]

WAITRESS: Coffee?

DARYL: Sure.

WAITRESS: Are you black?

[Elaine looks up]

WAITRESS: Or should I bring some cream?

DARYL: I'm black. Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream.

[The couple at the table next to them gets up to leave. They look at Elaine and Daryl and make a comment]

DARYL: Did you hear that?

ELAINE: What?

DARYL: God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.

ELAINE: Interracial? Us?

DARYL: Isn't that unbelievable!?

ELAINE: Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!

DARYL: I don't feel like eating.

ELAINE: Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.


[Outside the Rosses]

GEORGE: So, here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.

MRSROSS: Sounds grand.

GEORGE: Do you have your bathing suits?

MRROSS: It's March.

GEORGE: Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons.

[The Rosses get in the car]

GEORGE: Alright, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!


[In Florida at the Seinfeld condo]

JERRY: Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin.

[Kramer comes walking out in a retirement like athletic sweatsuit]

JERRY: Dad, you look so different.

KRAMER: Oh no, we're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one must walk among them.

MORTY: This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!

KRAMER: Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.

JERRY: You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.

MORTY: Daily what?

HELEN: Have you read today's Boca Breeze?

KRAMER: Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.

MORTY: Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.

KRAMER: Well, I couldn't find my shoes.

JERRY: Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.

HELEN: Who wants hot chocolate?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, me!

MORTY: This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.

KRAMER: Alright, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?

JERRY: Wizards!

KRAMER: Yeah, well how about if we give one out to every member on the condo board.

JERRY: Kramer...

MORTY: There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.

KRAMER: Payoffs. Now we're playing politics. Alright, what do we do next Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?

MORTY: First, I need a nap.

HELEN: Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!

JERRY: Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.

KRAMER: Well, what about your deal, huh?

JERRY: I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?

KRAMER: Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.

JERRY: Down here?

KRAMER: Yeah, Bob Sacamano’s father.


[In George's car]

[George is driving in the car with the Rosses]

GEORGE: And that leads into the master bedroom.

MRSROSS: Tell us more.

GEORGE: You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.

MRROSS: Another solarium?

GEORGE: Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too.

MRROSS: What are their names?

GEORGE: Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?

MRSROSS: Oh look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.

GEORGE: Housewarming gift.

[He swerves the car to go to the antique stand]

GEORGE: Alright, we're taking it up a notch!


[At Monk's Cafe]

BLACKWAITRESS: Here you go.

ELAINE: Long day?

BLACKWAITRESS: Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.

ELAINE: I hear you, sister.

BLACKWAITRESS: Sister?

[Daryl enters]

ELAINE: Yeah. It's okay, my boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?

DARYL: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Hey.

BLACKWAITRESS: He's black?

ELAINE: Yeah.

DARYL: I'm black?

ELAINE: Aren't you?

BLACKWAITRESS: I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.

DARYL: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.

DARYL: We are. Because you're Hispanic.

ELAINE: I am?

DARYL: Aren't you?

ELAINE: No. Why would you think that?

DARYL: Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.

ELAINE: That's because I thought you were black.

DARYL: Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?

ELAINE: I don't think we should be talking about this.

DARYL: So, what are you?

ELAINE: I'm white.

DARYL: So, we're just a couple of white people?

ELAINE: I guess.

DARYL: Oh.

ELAINE: Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?

DARYL: Sure.


[In Florida at the Seinfeld condo]

[Kramer is having lunch with Jerry and the Seinfeld's]

KRAMER: Oh, well I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leaving any tips where he is.

JERRY: Aw.

MORTY: Congratulations, Mr. President.

KRAMER: Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.

SID: Hey Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?

MORTY: What are you talking about?

SID: It's over tipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.

MORTY: This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.

JERRY: A Willard? Sacamano Sr. screwed me!

TOM: Mine doesn't have a seven!

RUBIN: I'm ruined!

MORTY: Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?

JERRY: Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.

MORTY: You didn't have a deal?

JERRY: No deal. Not hot.

SID: Morty, you and Kramer, you're finished.

KRAMER: What?

SID: Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.

KRAMER: Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm heading back to New York.

JERRY: Dad, I'm sorry.

MORTY: You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!

JERRY: It does other things!


[Outside George's Car on a beach]

MRROSS: Where are we George?

GEORGE: Almost there.

MRROSS: Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?

GEORGE: We uh, we go on foot from here.

MRROSS: Alright.

[George turns to start walking but finally breaks down]

GEORGE: There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.

MRROSS: We know.

GEORGE: Then why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?

MRSROSS: We don't like you, George.

MRROSS: And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.

GEORGE: Oh.

MRROSS: Alright! Let's head back.
