[At Jerry's apartment, he's on the phone]

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Uh huh.

[George knock on the counter and muffles his voice]

GEORGE: Chinese food!

JERRY: Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run.

[He hangs up the phone]

JERRY: All you.

GEORGE: Who was it?

JERRY: I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new Saab.

GEORGE: What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?

JERRY: No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.

GEORGE: Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.

JERRY: Why? He's harmless.

GEORGE: Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.

JERRY: He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.

GEORGE: I made him up.

JERRY: So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Too bad. It was erotic.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Well, I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!

[He slams a stack of magazines on the kitchen counter]

JERRY: "Pottery Barn"?

KRAMER: I got three Pottery Barn catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.

GEORGE: Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?

JERRY: Why don't you just throw them out?

KRAMER: Oh no, I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. Pottery Barn is in for a world of hurt.

JERRY: Can I have one? I need one of those old looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?

GEORGE: I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.

JERRY: So call now.

GEORGE: I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you were right abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?

JERRY: That's him.

GEORGE: Is he still nuts?

JERRY: What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of, "So, who's from out of town?"


[At Monk's Cafe]

PUDDY: Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had or what?

ELAINE: Mmm. Delish.

PUDDY: Delish?

ELAINE: Delish. You know, short for delicious.

PUDDY: Oh, like scrump.

ELAINE: Yeah.

PUDDY: I'm gonna be late. See you later.

JACK: Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?

ELAINE: Oh, sure.

[She passes him the ketchup]

JACK: Thank you.

[Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face]


[George is at his apartment calling his folks]

ESTELLE: Hello?

GEORGE: Hey, it's Georgie.

ESTELLE: Let me put your father on the phone.

GEORGE: Ma!

FRANK: Who is this?

GEORGE: Dad, it's me. Hey listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day and you know what, you were right.

[Estelle feigns a muffled Chinese voice]

ESTELLE: Chinese food.

FRANK: Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.

[He hangs up]

GEORGE: Chinese food?


[Outside the Pottery Barn]

KRAMER: Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like getting them back!?

[He throws his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store]


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: So, maybe they had Chinese food?

GEORGE: After dark? Please. At their age that's like swallowing stun grenades.

JERRY: Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food.

[He opens the fridge]

JERRY: There's leftovers.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Well gentlemen, Lainey is...

[She snaps the waist band on her pants]

ELAINE: ...in love.

GEORGE: That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.

ELAINE: Hey hey hey! I met this guy! And it was like this totally unreal fairy tale moment.

JERRY: It wasn't Whitey Fisk was it?

ELAINE: Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?

GEORGE: Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.

JERRY: So, this is beautiful. You and Puddy and this new guy in a big pot of love stew.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Will you look at this? More catalogs! "Omaha Steaks", "Mac Warehouse", "Newsweek"?! I can't stop all these companies so I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.

JERRY: Stop the mail?

KRAMER: That's... even better!


[Jerry and Elaine are walking on the street]

FRANKIE: Jerry!

JERRY: Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?

FRANKIE: This is it.

JERRY: Inside the van?

FRANKIE: It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?

JERRY: We were ten.

FRANKIE: Come on. Let's take it for a spin.

[He gets in the van]

JERRY: I don't want a van.

ELAINE: Well, just tell him you want the Saab.

JERRY: You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.

ELAINE: Well, I have an idea. Keep the van and get a bumper sticker that says, "If this vans a rocking, don't come a knocking."

JERRY: Always helpful.


[At the Costanza's house]

ESTELLE: Oh Georgie, what are you doing here?

GEORGE: Just dropped in for a visit. You uh, you never called me back.

ESTELLE: Uh... the phone broke.

FRANK: Well, we got to get moving.

GEORGE: What? Where are you going?

FRANK: We have a catered affair.

GEORGE: You're going like that?

FRANK: It's creative black tie. Move, woman.

[They leave]

[George checks the fridge]

GEORGE: No Chinese leftovers. George is getting suspicious.


[At Monk's Cafe]

JACK: Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.

[Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face]

JACK: I'm gonna be in the can.

ELAINE: Okay, Jack. Can I use your phone?

CASHIER: Sure.

ELAINE: Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.


[In Jerry's Van]

FRANKIE: Nice captain's chairs, huh?

JERRY: Aye aye.

FRANKIE: Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.

[Jerry tries to back up but a beeping starts]

JERRY: Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.

FRANKIE: No, that's us.

JERRY: Great. You know Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?

FRANKIE: You don't like the van?

JERRY: No no no. Just hypothetically.

FRANKIE: I gotta go to the park.

JERRY: No! No you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.


[Jerry and Kramer's are in the apartment building lobby]

[Kramer is showing his mailbox]

KRAMER: Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.

JERRY: Where'd you get the bricks?

KRAMER: Jerry, the whole building is brick.

JERRY: So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.

KRAMER: A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.

JERRY: I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: Come on Jerry, just let me help you.

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: Alright! Okay! Right, here we go. Yeah. Okay, so... "For sale. A big, juicy van." And oh, you gotta put down "interesting trades considered."

JERRY: I don't want to trade.

KRAMER: No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.

JERRY: Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're putting it in my box now.

KRAMER: Oh, that's it. They have gone too far! They keep pushing me and pushing me! Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: Hey Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack.

[Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face]


[At the post office]

POSTALCLERK: May I help you?

KRAMER: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.

POSTALCLERK: Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?

KRAMER: Oh, no no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.

NEWMAN: I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down everyone. No one's canceling any mail.

KRAMER: Oh yes I am.

NEWMAN: What about your bills?

KRAMER: The bank can pay them.

NEWMAN: The bank. What about your cards and letters?

KRAMER: E-mail, telephones, fax machines. FedEx, telex, telegrams, holograms.

NEWMAN: Alright, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.

SUPERVISOR: Is everything alright here, Postal Employee Newman?

NEWMAN: Yes sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?

KRAMER: Oh yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!


[At the Costanza's house]

[Frank and Estelle return to find George in the kitchen]

GEORGE: Welcome back.

ESTELLE: Oh!

GEORGE: Quick for a... catered affair.

FRANK: I don't know what you mean.

GEORGE: You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!

FRANK: George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.

ESTELLE: The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.

FRANK: What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.

GEORGE: I'm not following.

FRANK: We're cutting you lose.

GEORGE: You're cutting me loose?

FRANK: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: They don't want to see me anymore!

JERRY: But this is what you've always wanted.

GEORGE: It is. I'm just not ready yet.

JERRY: Aw, that's kind of sweet.

GEORGE: Ah, shut up Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.

JERRY: Oh no. George, please. What are you going to do?

GEORGE: You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.

JERRY: Mother of God.

GEORGE: One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. 
[He looks at the TV]

GEORGE: Who is this guy?

JERRY: That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?

[On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz. He's chanting, "Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!"]

JERRY: That is the guy!

GEORGE: Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?

JERRY: No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.

GEORGE: That's pretty pathetic.

JERRY: I know. They're not even related.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey.

GEORGE: Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.

JERRY: Hey, have fun at the... family reunion.

[George leaves]

JERRY: So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?

ELAINE: Isn't he the best?

JERRY: Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?

ELAINE: Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.

JERRY: Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to say, this?

[He turns on the TV]

[On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz. He is chanting, "Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!"]

ELAINE: Oh no.

JERRY: Oh yes.


[At Jerry's apartment later that day. Jerry answers the phone]

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Yeah, I called about the van.


[At a restaurant. George is with his cousin, Rhisa]

GEORGE: Some more merlot?

RHISA: Yeah, thanks.

[George fills her glass]

GEORGE: Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you...

[Rhisa slurps down the whole glass of wine]

GEORGE: ...very attractive.

RHISA: What?

GEORGE: I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.

RHISA: You want to borrow money, right?

GEORGE: No no. I, I just want us to be... together.

RHISA: Alright.

GEORGE: Alright?

RHISA: Let's go for it.

GEORGE: Well... we could dance around it a little first.

RHISA: Nah. Let's be bad, George. Let's be really... bad.

[She plays footsie with George]

GEORGE: Whoa! Whoa! Geez!


[On the Street]

[Kramer is inspecting the van]

KRAMER: So, how come you're selling it?

JERRY: You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.

KRAMER: How many miles?

JERRY: Two.

KRAMER: City or highway?

JERRY: Look, do you really want to buy this thing or what?

KRAMER: Hey hey, take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent?

[He bends the antenna making it break off]

KRAMER: I'm not paying for that.

JERRY: Alright, just get out of here.

KRAMER: Alright look, I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.

JERRY: Okay, fine. What do I have to do to put you in this van today?

KRAMER: Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, "interesting trades considered."

JERRY: You put that in!

KRAMER: And I'm glad I did. Here.

[He pulls out an undershirt]

JERRY: You want to trade me an undershirt?

KRAMER: No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit ups in the park and I nabbed it.

JERRY: That's disgusting.

KRAMER: Well, it's my final offer.


[At a restaurant]

PUDDY: You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.

ELAINE: Look, I'm sorry Puddy. It, it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us and we can continue like this never happened.

PUDDY: Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.

ELAINE: You're not taking me back?

PUDDY: That's right.

ELAINE: He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody.


[On the Street. Kramer is handing out anti mail pamphlets. He has a dummy of a mailman with a bucket on its head propped up against the van]

KRAMER: Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.

OLDWOMAN: Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?

KRAMER: Because we're blind to their tyranny.

OLDWOMAN: Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?

KRAMER: Yeah. Move along, Betty.

FRANKIE: Is this uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?

KRAMER: Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.

FRANKIE: I'm uh, I'm so stupid.

KRAMER: What?

FRANKIE: I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

[He runs away]

KRAMER: Yeah, nice to meet you.


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: She's into it?

GEORGE: She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.

JERRY: So have your parents found out about it?

GEORGE: She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.

JERRY: Brave new world, alright.

[Kramer enters with the mailman dummy]

KRAMER: Hey, you guys.

JERRY: Hey, how's the anti mail campaign going?

KRAMER: Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today and not one person went in.

JERRY: It's Sunday.

GEORGE: Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?

KRAMER: Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.

GEORGE: Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.

JERRY: Hey, I want my van keys back.

KRAMER: Oh, well. I uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.

JERRY: Are you insane? Give them to me.

KRAMER: No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.

GEORGE: Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.

KRAMER: Oh listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.

JERRY: Oh no, not Frankie.

KRAMER: Well, I didn't catch his name but then he went running into the park.

JERRY: Oh no, the woods! The hole!


[On the street]

[Kramer is walking along with his mailman dummy]

[Newman pulls alongside in a mail truck]

KRAMER: Hey.

NEWMAN: Kramer, what the hell are you doing?

KRAMER: I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.

NEWMAN: Not that!

KRAMER: What?

NEWMAN: You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen. You may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you and a door will open and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.

KRAMER: Are you through?

NEWMAN: No! And no one will ever see you again!

KRAMER: Are you through?

NEWMAN: Yes. No, wait! Okay, yes.

[He sees two postal security officials walking towards Kramer]

NEWMAN: Quick! Get in!

KRAMER: Oh, no no no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.

NEWMAN: There's another way it can go down and it's going down right now!

KRAMER: No. You said a mailman I know and you're a mailman I know!

NEWMAN: I know you know, but you don't know what I know.

[Kramer is grabbed and dragged away by the post office security officials]

KRAMER: Hey!


[In the woods]

JERRY: Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?

HOLEDIGGER: My name is Edgar.

JERRY: Have a nice night.

HOLEDIGGER: Thank you.



[Another part of the Woods. Frankie is digging a hole for himself]

FRANKIE: Stupid... so stupid!

[He sees Jerry's van pull up]

FRANKIE: Jerry?


[Inside the van]

RHISA: Alright, George. I'm ready.

GEORGE: Yeah, hold on. I'm uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?

RHISA: Georgie.

[Frankie runs up to the driver's window and starts yelling]

FRANKIE: Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!

RHISA: Wait. What's he saying?

GEORGE: I think he's saying Son of Sam! Oh my God!

RHISA: No, they caught him.

[George bursts out of the back of the van]

GEORGE: I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!

FRANKIE: Oh.


[At Monk's Cafe]

ELAINE: So I told him, "Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack."

JACK: Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.

ELAINE: Really, what was the first?

[Jack pulls out his Wiz hat]

JACK: They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.

ELAINE: What?

[He starts prancing back and forth]

JACK: I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!

ELAINE: Well what, what about your fact checking job?

JACK: Oh, here's a fact. Uh, I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and nobody beats me!


[In the woods. Jerry finds Frankie in his hole]

JERRY: Frankie, come on out of there.

FRANKIE: You hate the van.

JERRY: But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.

FRANKIE: So, can we go for a ride?

JERRY: Yeah, let's just get out of here.

[Another nocturnal dirt digger approaches them]

HOLEDIGGERTWO: Are you done with that?



[Another part of the woods]

[Frank approaches the van]

FRANK: Good. He left the door unlocked.

ESTELLE: Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?

FRANK: Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.

[They look inside the van]

ESTELLE: Wow!

FRANK: Hey, look at this.

[He presses a button and the back seats fold down into a couch]

FRANK: Hoochie mama!


[At the post office]

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Oh my goodness. What have they done to you here?

KRAMER: Huh? Who are you?

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Well, you can just call me Henry.

KRAMER: Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Last time I checked.

KRAMER: Henry... can I get out of here now?

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from DC just to talk to you.

KRAMER: Oh?

POSTMASTERGENERAL: I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah.

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Kramer, I've been uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you, you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs door to door.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He laughs]

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to by God get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.

KRAMER: I'm very, very sorry.

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?

KRAMER: Sure do!

[Kramer stands and salutes]

POSTMASTERGENERAL: Now, that's better.

[Kramer goes to leave and runs into Newman. He is being escorted in with a bucket over his head]

KRAMER: Geez. Newman?

NEWMAN: Tell the world my story.


[In the woods]

JERRY: Hey, George!

GEORGE: Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!

JERRY: What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.

GEORGE: Oh. The summer me.

FRANKIE: The winter me.

JERRY: You must be George's cousin.

RHISA: Girlfriend.

JERRY: Alright.

[George sees that the van is rocking]

GEORGE: What is that? That van's a rocking.

JERRY: Don't go a knocking.

[George opens the rear doors to the van and witnesses Frank and Estelle getting intimate]

ESTELLE: Oh my god!

GEORGE: Oh my god!

FRANKIE: Now you gotta sell this van.

JERRY: Oh yeah.


[At the Costanza's house]

FRANK: What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.

GEORGE: Oh.

ESTELLE: Your father's right. It's beautiful.

FRANK: And it was safe.

GEORGE: Oh God...

FRANK: Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...

GEORGE: Oh... make it stop.
