[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them, "You know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think it's about time, you know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doing this, "You know I think Joe might be a little..."

[He waves his hand back and forth]

JERRY: They should vacuum. "You know I think Joe might be..."

[He makes vacuuming noises and motions]

JERRY: "Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little..."

[He makes more vacuuming noises and motions]


[The scene opens with George dropping off his date for the night. She obviously has had a wonderful evening]

ALLISON: I don't want to live! I don't want to live!

GEORGE: Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!

ALLISON: No... you're something.

GEORGE: You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!

ALLISON: You're good. You're good!

GEORGE: I'm bad. I'm bad!

[She shakes her fists]

ALLISON: You're killing me!


[At Monk's Cafe. George, Jerry and Elaine are dining. Jerry is over making a phone call while George and Elaine talk at the table]

GEORGE: So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.

ELAINE: Over you?

GEORGE: Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

[Cut to Jerry who is over at the phone]

JERRY: Yeah, I'm trying to get in touch with Sharon Leonard she works for the NYU paper, this is Jerry Seinfeld. She's supposed to meet me at a coffee shop to do an interview.

[Back to George and Elaine]

ELAINE: What are you going to get Jerry for his birthday?

GEORGE: I got him a great gift.

ELAINE: Really, what?

GEORGE: I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".

ELAINE: Oh, that is a good gift. Maybe he'll take me.

GEORGE: No, I'm going to go with him. What did you get him?

ELAINE: I got him a two line phone.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's good.

[Jerry returns to the booth and explains the phone call]

JERRY: Unbelievable! She's not there.

GEORGE: What paper does she write for?

JERRY: She works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.

ELAINE: Never even seen you? Gotta kind of envy that...

JERRY: You know, you've been developing quite the acid tongue lately.

ELAINE: Really?

[The camera pans out some so that we can see the three at their table and a girl sitting with her back to George at the next table. She starts to become interested in what the people behind her are talking about as Elaine pops the following philosophical dilemma to her companions]

ELAINE: Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?

JERRY: Living or all time?

ELAINE: All time.

JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

ELAINE: I don’t know. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?

GEORGE: Lyndon Johnson was uglier than DeGaulle.

ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Mier could make them all run up a tree.

JERRY: Golda Mier?

[Elaine notices the woman sitting behind George is eavesdropping on their conversation]

ELAINE: Hey, come here.

[She motions for them to lean in]

ELAINE: Those two girls behind you, they're eavesdropping.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: You know uh, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.

[She smiles to encourage them to go along with it]

[Jerry rolls his eyes and turns away in disbelief while George on the other hand addresses Jerry directly]

GEORGE: So, what do you say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.

JERRY: What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: Come on, go along...

JERRY: I'm not going along. I can just see you in Berlin in nineteen thirty-nine goose stepping past me, "Come on Jerry, go along, go along..." You know I hear that all the time.

ELAINE: Hear what?

JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

ELAINE: Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.

JERRY: Yeah, because I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.

[Sharon gets up from the table behind them and goes to the phone]

ELAINE: And you get along well with women.

GEORGE: I guess that leaves me in the clear.

[Over at the payphone]

SHARON: Hi Jerry it's Sharon from the NYU paper. I'm here at the coffee shop and I was a little late. I guess we must have missed each other.

[Back at the table]

JERRY: I'm going to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Me too.

[At the payphone]

SHARON: I'm going to be here a little while longer and I'll try to hook up with you later.

[Jerry and George pass Sharon on the way to the bathroom. She notices them going into the bathroom together]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry is unpacking groceries and George comes in]

JERRY: Hi.

GEORGE: I just thought of a great name for myself if I ever become a porno actor.

JERRY: Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?

GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?

JERRY: You told me that already like two months ago.

GEORGE: Let me ask you something, what do you think of this shirt?

JERRY: Eh.

GEORGE: Allison bought it for me.

JERRY: How you gonna get out of that one?

GEORGE: I don't know. I guess I have to wait for her to die.

[The intercom buzzes]

JERRY: Yeah?

[On the intercom]

SHARON: Sharon from NYU.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: Who was that?

JERRY: Oh, that's that reporter from NYU. She's finally going to do the interview. I told her to come up here so this way we wouldn't miss each other.

GEORGE: Do you want me to stay?

JERRY: Sure, I don't care.

[There's a knock on the door]

[Jerry opens the door]

JERRY: Hi.

[She notices Jerry and looks a little stunned, then extends her hand to shake]

SHARON: Hi, I'm, I'm Sharon.

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. Something the matter?

SHARON: No no no, nothing.

JERRY: You look familiar, have we ever met?

SHARON: I'm not sure, have we?

JERRY: You look familiar. Uh, why don't we do this over here.

[He motions to the couch]

JERRY: This is George.

SHARON: Oh hi, nice to meet you.

[George waves]

JERRY: He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?

SHARON: Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.

JERRY: Oh. Okay.

[They sit down on the couch. Sharon puts a tape recorder on the coffee table]

GEORGE: Uh oh.

SHARON: Oh, is that a problem?

GEORGE: I, I just hate my, my voice on tape. It always sounds so high and whiny.

[He waves both hands in the air]

SHARON: Shall we start?

JERRY: Fire away.

SHARON: Okay, let's see, um, are you just a comedian or do you do anything else?

JERRY: George and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

SHARON: Oh, so you also work together?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Jerry did you wash this pear?

JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.

GEORGE: It looks like it hasn't been washed.

JERRY: So wash it.

GEORGE: You hear the way he talks to me?

[She smiles at their behavior]

SHARON: You should hear how my boyfriend talks to me.

[Again, Jerry seems confused as to what Sharon is saying. Something's not quite right. But before another question can be asked George has a question for Sharon]

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Hey uh, let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?

SHARON: It's nice.

GEORGE: Jerry said he didn't like it.

JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was okay.

GEORGE: No, you said you didn't like it.

JERRY: Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world or something?

SHARON: So how did you two meet?

[George sits next to Jerry on the couch]

JERRY: Oh, actually we met in the um, gym locker room.

GEORGE: Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. And uh, I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and I fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.

[George takes a hold of Jerry's leg to stress the point and Sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question]

SHARON: Do you guys live together?

JERRY: Live together?

GEORGE: No, I got my own place.

[Jerry is about this close to figuring out what is going on here, when the "question fatale" is asked]

SHARON: Oh, and do your parents know?

JERRY: Know what?

GEORGE: My parents? They don't know what's going on.

[Jerry finally realizes what is going on]

JERRY: Oh God! You're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us! I knew you looked familiar!

[George jumps up]

GEORGE: Oh no! No!

[All three rise from the couch and a rather excited Jerry and George try to explain things to a very confused reporter]

SHARON: I better get going.

[She moves towards the door]

JERRY: There's been a big misunderstanding here!

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah!

JERRY: We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean its fine if that's who you are.

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends.

GEORGE: My father is gay.

SHARON: Look, I know, I know what I heard.

JERRY: Heard, it was a joke.

GEORGE: Look, you wanna have sex right now!? Do want to have sex with me right now!? Let's go!

[He motions towards the bedroom]

GEORGE: Come on, let's go baby! Come on!

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey, Come on! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: No steam! No steam!

KRAMER: Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!


[At Jerry's apartment later]

JERRY: The whole thing is your fault.

ELAINE: You want me to talk to her? I'd be perfectly willing to talk to her.

JERRY: I don't think so.

ELAINE: Walk into a room, problem solved.

JERRY: She said she's going to think about it.

ELAINE: Eh, so what if it does come out. It will just be in an NYU paper.

JERRY: Why don't you take your jacket off.

ELAINE: Nah, I'm okay.

JERRY: I'm going to try her again.

[Kramer enters abruptly, nearly hitting Elaine with the door. He holds a gift in his hands]

KRAMER: Happy birthday paruba!

JERRY: Today's not my birthday.

KRAMER: Well, I beg to differ.

JERRY: Well I think I know when my birthday is.

KRAMER: Yeah well you'd think so but you'd be wrong.

[Jerry snatches the gift]

JERRY: Maybe he's right, maybe it is my birthday. Would you take the jacket off.

ELAINE: Leave me alone! Get off my back about the jacket.

[He opens the gift]

JERRY: Oh, look at this! A phone! A two line phone!

[Elaine can be seen mouthing the word "shit" and is, for some reason, not impressed with the gift. She picks up her purse to leave]

JERRY: That's terrific! Now when someone is talking on the phone I can still make a call. Look Elaine, a two line phone!

ELAINE: Yeah I see it.

[Kramer hooks up the phone]

KRAMER: I'm going to get one myself.

JERRY: Where you going?

ELAINE: I gotta go return something.

[She leaves]

[Jerry picks up the receiver]

JERRY: I got a dial tone. Okay, this is the maiden call.

KRAMER: Oh wait, wait. I want to get the first call alright?

JERRY: Alright go to your house I'll call you.

[Kramer leaves]

[Jerry dials the phone]

KRAMER: Hello.

JERRY: Hello? Hey, it's working. This is great, thanks a lot.

KRAMER: Happy birthday buddy.

[Jerry's phone makes a clicking noise]

JERRY: Oh wait, I got a call on the other line.

KRAMER: Okay, later.

JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.

[He taps the phone]

JERRY: Hello?

SHARON: Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.

JERRY: Oh, hi.

SHARON: I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.

JERRY: Thank you very much, that's great.

[The phone clicks]

JERRY: Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line.

[He taps the phone]

JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, how you doing? You know I got that uh, reporter from the newspaper on the other line.

GEORGE: So what did she say?

JERRY: Oh, she said she's not going to play up that, that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. I guess we fooled her. Alright I'll get rid of her, hold on.

[He taps the phone]

JERRY: Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there?

[He taps the phone]

JERRY: I'm back.

GEORGE: You know... I could hear you on the other line.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: I heard what you said, "Sharon, are you there?"

JERRY: You heard me talking on the other line, are you sure?

GEORGE: Yes, I heard you!

JERRY: Well maybe she was disconnected.

GEORGE: Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!

JERRY: Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on.

[He dials Kramer's number]

KRAMER: Hello?

JERRY: Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on.

[He taps the phone]

GEORGE: "There may be a problem with the phone, hold on!"

JERRY: Oh no!

[He taps the phone]

JERRY: Kramer this phone's a piece of junk goodbye!

GEORGE: "This phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!"

JERRY: Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?

GEORGE: Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it.

JERRY: No no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!


[We shift to Sharon's apartment where Elaine is paying a visit]

ELAINE: Hi.

SHARON: Hi, Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah, nice to meet you.

SHARON: Thanks for meeting with me.

ELAINE: Sure.

SHARON: Ah, would you like to take a seat?

ELAINE: Sure, thank you.

SHARON: Why don't you uh, take your coat off?

[Elaine just stares at her]


[At Monk's Cafe. Jerry, George, and Elaine are drinking coffee]

ELAINE: So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.

JERRY: She didn't take her coat off at my house, either.

GEORGE: You know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house the families go to war!

ELAINE: Give me a break.

JERRY: So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: Not at all.

[Jerry tries to forcibly remove the coat in pursuit of some satisfaction]

JERRY: Take that coat off!

ELAINE: No, I'm not going to!

[They grapple with each other for several seconds]

GEORGE: Anyway, when are we going to see her. I'd like to read the article.

JERRY: They're sending it to me.

GEORGE: Well, here you go, happy birthday.

[He hands Jerry a card]

JERRY: Thank you.

GEORGE: Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!

JERRY: "Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?

GEORGE: It's "Guys And Dolls", not "Guys And Guys".

JERRY: You're right, it's "Guys and Dolls", thanks, thank you very much.

ELAINE: Alright, well, happy birthday.

[She hands Jerry a colorful bag]

JERRY: Oh Lainey!

[He looks at the gift]

JERRY: "The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".

ELAINE: I thought you liked that king of music.

JERRY: Oh, she's alright.

ELAINE: You said you liked her.

JERRY: Well, so what, maybe I do like her, so what!

ELAINE: So nothing.

JERRY: Well thanks for the CD's.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, your welcome.

[Elaine notices that there are a couple of guys pointing at Jerry from the other side of the cafe]

ELAINE: Why are those two people pointing at you over there?

JERRY: I don't know.

[Jerry looks at them and points at himself. They point to him and then a newspaper they are reading. He goes over to investigate]

JERRY: What do you got there?

MANONEATCAFE: The New York Post, they've got an article about you.

JERRY: "Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long time companion seem to be inseparable." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!

GEORGE: Now everyone's going to think we're gay!

[He covers his face with his hands]

JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: No, not at all.


[Back at Jerry's apartment, they read from The Post]

JERRY: "Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor pad, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of fruit like an old married couple." I told you that pear was washed!

[He throws the paper down on the table]

[Kramer Enters. He has the newspaper article in his hands]

KRAMER: I thought we were friends.

JERRY: Here we go.

KRAMER: I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?

JERRY: It's not true!

KRAMER: Ah! Enough lying! The lying is through! Now come on Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...

JERRY: So are you.

KRAMER: Yeah.

[It's at this point that Kramer, well, "Pulls a Kramer". He does that mini-epileptic, losing his balance thing and he retreats to his apartment, probably to confront his own sexuality. In Jerry's apartment the phone rings. George answers]

GEORGE: Hello?

HELEN: George?

GEORGE: Mrs. Seinfeld?!

HELEN: Oh my God.

JERRY: Oh my God!

[He takes the phone]

JERRY: Ma?

HELEN: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma!

GEORGE: Oh my God! My mother!!!

[Back at Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld's place, the conversation continues]

HELEN: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma, it's not true!

MORTY: It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!

HELEN: They weren't culottes, they were shorts.

MORTY: They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.

HELEN: By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!

MORTY: It looked like he was wearing a skirt for crying out loud!

JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!

HELEN: Not that there's anything wrong with that Jerry.


[Back at the Metropolitan Hospital Center, George pays his mother a visit. She seems to be in the same bed from The Contest episode. That includes the thin sheet covering that allowed for that infamous silhouette]

ESTELLE: I open up the paper and this is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move. The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!

GEORGE: It's not true!

ESTELLE: Every day it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows what you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.

GEORGE: Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.

ESTELLE: Who, Buck Naked? Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.

GEORGE: Of course not.

[In comes a hulking male nurse. He parts the screen and announces]

MALENURSE: Six thirty Scott. Time for your sponge bath.

[It's deja vu all over again! Except instead of a couple of women behind the screen there are two guys]

SCOTT: Six thirty all ready? I fell asleep.

MALENURSE: Let me help you off with that. Here, I'll just slip it over your head.

[He removes Scott's gown. The silhouette of their actions is visible against the separating screen. George is staring uncomfortably]

MALENURSE: The water is nice and warm, isn't it.

SCOTT: Oh, that feels real good.

ESTELLE: George, are you telling me the truth?

[George doesn't hear her]

ESTELLE: George, I'm talking to you!


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: Hey, you'll never guess who left a message on my machine? That reporter from NYU. I wonder what she wants.

GEORGE: Alright, the play is tomorrow night. Would you like to have dinner first or meet at the theatre?

[A serviceman approaches the table]

SERVICEMAN: Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.

[He leaves]

JERRY: You know what? I think I'll pass on the Guys and Dolls.

GEORGE: Alright, fine, don't go. I try and go out and do something special for your birthday and this is the thanks I get! Everything's tainted now.

JERRY: Would you keep your voice down!

GEORGE: No, I will not keep my voice down!! Nothing can make me keep my voice down!!

[He smacks the table]

[The cook approaches the table]

MONKSMANAGER: If you boys cannot control yourselves then I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

[He stares menacingly at George, then leaves]

GEORGE: Fine, I'll take Elaine.

ELAINE: Yes.

GEORGE: Just don't say anything to Alice.

ELAINE: No I won't. Did she see the article?

GEORGE: No. Just imagine her reaction.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh my God.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think... I'm out baby!! I'm out!!

[He runs out]


[We flash forward to George dropping off Allison. She is mulling over the article that George has given her]

ALLISON: Yeah? So?

GEORGE: Yeah so?

ALLISON: Well this is nice. They mention your name.

GEORGE: Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?

ALLISON: No, what?

GEORGE: I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.

ALLISON: You're gay?

GEORGE: Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.

ALLISON: I don't believe it.

GEORGE: You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.

ALLISON: I will.

GEORGE: What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.

[She grabs George's lapels]

ALLISON: I want to hear it from Jerry.


[At Jerry's apartment. Sharon and Jerry are making out on the couch. Apparently, she's all turned around on the subject]

SHARON: Oh, can you ever forgive me?

JERRY: I don't know.

[They kiss again]

JERRY: Alright, I forgive you.

SHARON: You know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.

JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.

[They kiss again]

[George and Alice enter] 

GEORGE: Jerry! Oh my God! What are you doing!?!

JERRY: What!?

GEORGE: You're with a woman!

JERRY: I know! What are you doing here?!?

GEORGE: I leave you alone for two seconds and this is what you do! I trusted you!

[Jerry forcibly removing George from the apartment] 

JERRY: Would you get the hell out of here!

SHARON: What's, what's going on?

ALLISON: Yeah, what's going on?

GEORGE: Alright, tell her. Go ahead.

JERRY: Tell her what?

GEORGE: You know. About us.

[He tries to put his arm around Jerry. Jerry shakes it off]

JERRY: Are you crazy!

GEORGE: Tell her Jerry, tell her.

[He wraps his arms around Jerry]

JERRY: I'm not telling her nothing.

[Sharon gets up to leave]

SHARON: This is to weird.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you’re the girl who wrote the article. Go ahead, tell her.

SHARON: I'm out of here.

[She leaves]

JERRY: It's not true! It's not true! Not that there's anything wrong with that! You stupid idiot!

[George grabs Jerry's hands]

GEORGE: Please don't be upset.

[Jerry pulls away]

JERRY: Oh will you stop it with that stuff!

ALLISON: What is going on!

GEORGE: Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.

[Allison looks interested]

ALLISON: Really?

GEORGE: Oh my God.

[Allison takes George's arm, not quite the reaction he wanted. Kramer walks by the open door to go to his apartment. He is escorted by what appears to be a virile young man]

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey.

KRAMERSFRIEND: Hello.

[They stand there for a few seconds]

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

KRAMER: Alright, we'll see you later.
