[At Monk's Cafe] 

[Jerry and Kramer are sitting opposite Elaine at a booth eating lunch] 

JERRY: Let me ask you a question. 

ELAINE: Uh huh. 

JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists...

ELAINE: Who, me? 

JERRY: You, anybody, whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time. Do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry? 

ELAINE: They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention. 

[Kramer imitates a Turkish accent]

KRAMER: You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. Come on! Take it off, take it off! 

[Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state] 

KRAMER: Hey, Georgie. 

JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi. 

[George sits down next to Elaine, opposite Kramer] 

JERRY: What's the matter? 

GEORGE: My mother caught me. 

JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what? 

GEORGE: You know.

[All three give him blank stares]

GEORGE: I was alone...

ELAINE: You mean? 

GEORGE: Uh huh. 

[Kramer laughs]

KRAMER: She caught you? 

[Elaine laughs with Kramer] 

JERRY: Where? 

GEORGE: I stopped by the house to drop the car off and I went inside for a few minutes. Nobody was there, they're supposed to be working.

[Jerry and Elaine look at each other enjoying the story]

GEORGE: My mother had a Glamour magazine. I started leafing through it...

JERRY: "Glamour?"

[Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly] 

GEORGE: So, one thing led to another...

JERRY: So, what did she do? 

GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint. She started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. 

KRAMER: Man. 

GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling or zip up. 

JERRY: What did you do? 

GEORGE: I zipped up! 

ELAINE: So, she fell? 

GEORGE: Yeah.

[He noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid and gets defensive]

GEORGE: Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was! 

ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have done that.

JERRY: No, I wouldn't think so.  

GEORGE: So she fell and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So I picked her up and took her to the hospital. 

ELAINE: How is she? 

GEORGE: She's in traction. 

[Elaine laughs]

ELAINE: Okay, I'm sorry. 

GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine. 

ELAINE: I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious. 

GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why George, why?!" I said, "Because it's there!" 

[Kramer laughs, sipping his drink] 

JERRY: "Glamour"? 

[Elaine laughs] 

GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you this though, I am never doing... that... again. 

ELAINE: What, you mean in your mother's house or all together? 

GEORGE: All together. 

[The next three lines are said at the exact same time] 

ELAINE: Oh, give me a break.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right. 

KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop? 

JERRY: Come one.

ELAINE: Come on.

GEORGE: You don't think I can? 

JERRY: No chance. 

GEORGE: You think you could? 

JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. 

GEORGE: Care to make it interesting? 

JERRY: Sure, how much? 

GEORGE: A hundred dollars. 

JERRY: You're on. 

KRAMER: Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. 

JERRY: You? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check. 

ELAINE: I want to be in on this too. 

GEORGE: No no no.

JERRY: Oh no. It's apples and oranges. No no no.

ELAINE: Why? 

JERRY: It's apples and oranges.

ELAINE: What? Why?

[More no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent]

ELAINE: Why? 

JERRY: Because you're a woman! 

ELAINE: So what? 

JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. 

ELAINE: Oh. 

JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like uh... shaving. 

ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs. 

KRAMER: Not everyday. 

GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in? 

ELAINE: Yeah! 

GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one, you gotta put up two hundred dollars. 

KRAMER: No, a thousand! 

ELAINE: No, I'll, I'll put up one fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one fifty. 

JERRY: Okay, one fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, now how are we gonna monitor this thing? 

JERRY: Well, obviously we all know each other very well. I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 

KRAMER: Alright.

[Kramer holds out his pinkie at the center of the table] 

[Jerry, Elaine, and George all hook their pinkies onto his in a “pinkie promise”. They all pull their hands away yelling out "Yeah!"]


[At Jerry's apartment] 

[Jerry's sitting on the couch eating cereal while George is on the phone with his mother] 

GEORGE: No ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright.

[He hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry]

GEORGE: My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me?

[Scoffs, shaking his head]

GEORGE: You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist...

[He laughs and snorts] 

[Jerry waits for the rest of the sentence]

JERRY: Yeah? 

GEORGE: Whatever. 

[The intercom buzzes. Jerry gets up to answer it] 

JERRY: How is she? 

GEORGE: She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight. 

JERRY: Yeah? 

ELAINE: It's me. 

JERRY: Come on up. 

GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing tonight? 

JERRY: Dating Marla. 

GEORGE: Oh, the virgin? 

JERRY: Yeah. 

GEORGE: Any uh, progress there? What's the latest? 

JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border. I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go ahead. 

[Kramer enters and heads for Jerry's window] 

KRAMER: Hey look at this, come here. There's a naked woman across the street. 

[George and Jerry quickly join him at the window] 

JERRY: Where? 

KRAMER: Second floor from the top.

[He points]

KRAMER: See the window on the left? 

GEORGE: Wow! 

JERRY: Who walks around the house like that?! 

[All eyes are glued to the woman] 

GEORGE: Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.

KRAMER: Yeah... yeah...

[Kramer slowly stands up and walks out Jerry's apartment leaving Jerry and George with the view. He shuts the door behind him] 

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room? 

GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked. 

JERRY: What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too? 

GEORGE: They're naked, the gardeners naked, the bellhops.

[Jerry makes a noise of astonishment]

GEORGE: One big nude a rama. 

[Elaine enters] 

ELAINE: Hey. 

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey. 

ELAINE: Well, where's my money? Who caved? 

JERRY: Not me. 

GEORGE: Not me. 

ELAINE: What're you looking at? 

JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street. 

[She smiles and chuckles] 

ELAINE: This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my friend Joyce is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight. 

JERRY: Yeah, the, the waitress should've taken it back. 

ELAINE: So then, I got a call this morning. You know I was uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're going to Mars. 

JERRY: Uh huh. 

GEORGE: Have a good time. 

[Kramer casually enters and takes a few step towards the kitchen. He slaps a wad of bills onto the counter] 

KRAMER: I'm out! 

[Kramer now has the attention of everyone in the room. Jerry's mouth is open in shock. A moment passes] 

ELAINE: What?! 

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out, I'm out of the contest. 

GEORGE: You're out?! 

KRAMER: Yeah yeah. What? 

ELAINE: Well, that was fast! 

JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful buddy. She's gonna get you next.

[He walks out, shutting the door behind him] 

[Jerry, Elaine, and George all look at each other, reflecting] 

ELAINE: And then there were three. 


[In a hospital room] 

[Estelle is on a hospital bed. George is sitting back in a chair visiting her] 

ESTELLE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o'clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! 

GEORGE: Ma. 

ESTELLE: Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open. 

GEORGE: Ma, people can hear you. 

ESTELLE: Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star! 

GEORGE: Alright mah, that's enough! 

ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist. 

GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist! 

ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go? 

GEORGE: Because I don't want to. 

ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody. 

GEORGE: Well, I am not going. 

ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago. 

[George's cousin Shelly enters] 

SHELLY: Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you, how did this happen? 

GEORGE: Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?! 

[On the other side of a curtain divider, the silhouette of a shapely nurse can be seen entering] 

NURSE: Hi, Denise. Six thirty, time for your sponge bath. 

[The shadow of a patient awakening can be seen] 

DENISE: Mmm... is it six thirty already? I fell asleep. 

[The two women go about preparing the sponge bath. George is visibly affected, breathing heavily and staring at them through the curtain] 

SHELLY: So George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kind of television writing thing? 

[George slowly backs away, he's not at all committed to the conversation]

GEORGE: Yeah, television. 

[The patient, Denise, is trying to get her gown off] 

NURSE: Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head.

DENISE: Oh, thank you. 

SHELLY: Well it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street.

[As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized]

SHELLY: What is it you're doing, exactly? 

[A moment passes. George seems not to have heard his cousin] 

ESTELLE: George, your cousin Shelly is talking to you! 


[At the New York Health Club] 

[Elaine, dressed for a work-out, is signing forms while talking with her friend, Joyce] 

JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class? 

ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while. 

JOYCE: Are you psyched? 

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, I'm really... psyched. 

JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here. 

ELAINE: Why is that? 

[She points]

JOYCE: See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts? 

[Elaine looks over and her jaw drops to the floor. Breathless, she turns back to her friend] 

ELAINE: Oh my God. John F. Kennedy Junior's here! 

JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today. 

ELAINE: In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?! 

JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt. 

ELAINE: Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John John's butt. 


[In Jerry's car] 

[Jerry's girlfriend Marla and him are making out. After some deep kissing, Marla breaks away] 

MARLA: Let's slow it down a little. 

JERRY: "Slow it down?" 

MARLA: Well, you know...

JERRY: Ah yeah... I know. 

MARLA: You're okay with that, right? 

JERRY: Yeah yeah of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care about that. 

MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night then? 

JERRY: Sure, Saturday night. 

MARLA: Alright then, good night. 

JERRY: Goodnight.

[She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding]

JERRY: Not just a good night, a great night.

[She shuts the door. He waves] 


[In Jerry's bedroom late at night] 

[Jerry is moving around unable to get to sleep. He's restless. Scene cuts to George. He's wide awake and staring at the ceiling. Cut to Elaine. She's settling into bed unable to get to sleep. The scene takes a final cut to Kramer. He's sound asleep] 


[At Jerry's apartment] 

[Jerry's in a grouchy mood. Kramer enters] 

KRAMER: Good Morning! 

JERRY: Yeah, good morning. 

KRAMER: Ha ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time.

[He turns toward Jerry's window]

JERRY: She's not there. She's doing her wash. 

KRAMER: Oh. So, did you make it through the night? 

JERRY: Yes, I'm proud to say I did! 

KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain. 

JERRY: Yes. Yes I am.

[Kramer chuckles]

JERRY: Master of my domain. But I will tell you this, I am going over to her apartment and I'm telling her to put those shades down! 

KRAMER: Whoa whoa whoa. What, what did you just say? 

JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, when I'm here I'm climbing the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest, something's gotta give! 

KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?!

[Jerry puts on his coat]

KRAMER: This is a beautiful woman walking around naked and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think, I'm not gonna let you do it. 

JERRY: Well, I'm doing it. Get out of my way. 

KRAMER: No no no no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think, "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true and you want to...

[He makes a noise]

KRAMER: ...throw it away?! 

JERRY: Look, I'm sorry.

KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry. 

JERRY: Kramer, get out of my way! 

KRAMER: No no no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! Now come on. Please Jerry, Please! I'm begging you! Please!

[He claps his hands]

KRAMER: Come on! Please! 

[A pause as Jerry thinks it over] 

JERRY: Alright.

[He takes his coat off] 

KRAMER: Yes! 

JERRY: Alright. 

KRAMER: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

[He sits in Jerry's chair looking out the window] 

JERRY: She's not there! 

KRAMER: Oh, I can wait.


[At Monk's Cafe] 

[Jerry and George are sitting opposite each other in a booth] 

JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? 

GEORGE: Every night at six thirty. The nurse was gorgeous. Then I got a look at the patient.

[He laughs, then snorts]

GEORGE: I was going nuts. 

JERRY: Oh man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital. 

GEORGE: Well, my mother Jerry.

[Jerry nods] 

JERRY: But are you still master of your domain? 

GEORGE: I am king of the county. You? 

JERRY: Lord of the manor. 

[Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry] 

ELAINE: John F. Kennedy Junior! 

JERRY: What? 

ELAINE: He was in my aerobics class. 

JERRY: Really? Did you talk to him? 

ELAINE: No, you don't understand, he was working out right in front of me. So listen, after the class was over I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment and he says to me, "Quite a workout." 

GEORGE: "Quite a workout?" What did you say? 

ELAINE: I said, "Yeah." 

JERRY: Good one. 

ELAINE: So then listen, listen. So then I showered and I dressed and I saw him again on the way out.

[She is giddy and nearly out of breath]

ELAINE: So we're walking and talking and he asked me my name. And I think I said Elaine but I mean, who the hell knows. And so then he says to me, "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab and I mean, I have no idea where I'm going, right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talking about!

[She takes a deep breath]

ELAINE: So then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I, and I, and I was close to your block so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front...

[She laughs]

ELAINE: ...and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.

[She picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off]

ELAINE: Oh God.

JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain? 

ELAINE: I'm queen of the castle. 


[In Estelle's hospital room] 

[George quickly runs in and checks both his watch and the wall clock. He smiles to himself] 

ESTELLE: You're back. 

GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit. 

ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this. 

GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you? 

ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich.

GEORGE: You got it, Ma.

[She smiles back, nodding]

GEORGE: A little later.

[George sits back in a nearby chair looking at the divider in anticipation] 

ESTELLE: Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak. 

GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference? 

ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me! 

GEORGE: I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you. 

ESTELLE: But if you wait they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over! 

GEORGE: Ten minutes! Here here.

[He fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her] 
GEORGE: Have some Tic Tacs. 

ESTELLE: Get the hell out of here. I'm sorry you came. 

[The nurse enters] 

NURSE: Six thirty. Time for your sponge bath. 

[George eagerly takes his seat, looking up at their shadows on the divider] 

ESTELLE: George. I'm hungry! 

GEORGE: Hang on, Ma. Hang on.


[At the New York Health Club] 

[Elaine, dressed to impress, walks up to the counter. She's obviously looking around for JFK Jr.] 

JOYCE: Hi! 

ELAINE: Hi. 

JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today? 

ELAINE: No, I just uh, fixed it a little bit.

[Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath] 

JOYCE: You know who isn't here? He was in the early class today.

[Elaine looses her composure]

JOYCE: But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday. 

ELAINE: What? What? Who? Me me me? I made an impression? What impression? 

JOYCE: Let me just put this back.

[She turns to put a stack of shorts away] 

[Elaine violently grabs her jacket and pulls Joyce back in her direction] 

ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?! 

JOYCE: He asked about you. 

ELAINE: He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?!

[She hangs off the side of the counter with both feet in the air]

ELAINE: What did he say? 

JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation. 

ELAINE: What situation? I have a situation? 

JOYCE: I, I told him you were single. 

ELAINE: That was good. That was very good. 

JOYCE: He said you were just his type. 

ELAINE: Okay, you trying to hurt me? Are you trying to hurt, you're trying to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me. 

JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o'clock so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello. 

[Breathless, Elaine almost collapses] 


[At Jerry's apartment] 

[Kramer's at the window while Jerry's on the phone with his mother watching TV] 

JERRY: Alright ma, I'll talk to you later. Nothing. I'm, I'm watching uh, Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon. It's, I, I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

[He hangs up] 

KRAMER: Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.

[Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy]

KRAMER: It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed. that's good, that's good... yes yes yes.

[Jerry tryies to block out Kramer by singing along with the TV]

JERRY: The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus...

[Kramer joins in with Jerry, only he has a different version] 

KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on... 

[Both Kramer and Jerry continue to sing the two different versions, trying to over ride the other] 


[In George's room] 

[George is wide awake staring at the ceiling. Scene cuts to Jerry. Once again, he's restless and flings the covers off him. Scene cuts to Kramer. He's out like a light. The scene takes a final cut to Elaine. Foreshadowing the next scene, she's sound asleep too]


[At Jerry's apartment] 

[Jerry and George are bickering at each other due to the lack of sex] 

GEORGE: All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee? 

JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside!

[The intercom buzzes. He answers it]

JERRY: Yeah?! 

ELAINE: It's Elaine. 

JERRY: Come on up!

GEORGE: Where did you get those socks? 

JERRY: I don't know. 

GEORGE: I think those are my socks! 

JERRY: How are these your socks?! 

GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe and now I don't have them anymore! 

JERRY: Oh yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinking feet. They looked so good to me I just had to have them! 

GEORGE: Yeah well, they're my socks! 

JERRY: They're my socks! 

[A brief moment passes as they look at each other] 

GEORGE: Oh boy.

JERRY: What are we doing here?

GEORGE: Oh boy. 

JERRY: This is ridiculous. 

GEORGE: Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting. 

JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody. 

GEORGE: Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street. 

[Elaine slowly enters and shuts the door behind her] 

ELAINE: Hello.

[She pulls a wad of bills out of her purse and starts to count it up] 

GEORGE: You caved?! 

JERRY: It's over? 

GEORGE: You're out? 

JERRY: Oh my God. The Queen is dead. 

[Elaine sets the bills down on the counter] 

GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise at least through the Spring. 

JERRY: What happened? 

ELAINE: It was uh, John John. 

JERRY: Oh, John John.

GEORGE: Oh, John John. 

JERRY: But you made it through the day before. 

ELAINE: Yeah, but yesterday he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o'clock tonight. 

JERRY: Why outside here? 

ELAINE: Because he thinks I live here. Remember when we shared a cab and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up. 

[George picks up the money and counts it] 

JERRY: Alright Costanza, it's just you and me. 

GEORGE: And then...

[He smacks the money]

GEORGE: ...there were two. 

ELAINE: Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior. 


[At Jerry's apartment] 

[Jerry and Marla are making out on the couch] 

MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom. 

JERRY: Really? 

MARLA: Yes. 

JERRY: You sure? 

MARLA: Yes. 

JERRY: You really want to? 

MARLA: I do. I'm ready. 

JERRY: Okay.

MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you. 

JERRY: You don't know the half of it. 

[They both laugh slightly] 

MARLA: What do you mean? 

JERRY: Well, it's kind of silly, but...


[Elaine is on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch]


[At Jerry's apartment. Marla is upset and is putting her coat on] 

MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends? 

JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother.

MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind. 

[She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in his chair staring at the naked woman] 


[Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her and tries to hail a taxi]

ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh I'm glad I ran into you.

MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends.

[Confused, Elaine moves closer]

MARLA: Oh get away from me! You're horrible. Horrible! All of you! 


[At Jerry's apartment] 

ELAINE: What happened? 

JERRY: I told her about the contest. 

ELAINE: Oh boy, she's a whack-o. 

[George enters] 

GEORGE: Hey, what happened? 

ELAINE: What? 

GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy. 

ELAINE: He didn't show. 

GEORGE: Yeah he did. 

ELAINE: What? He's, He's out there? Oh my God. I, I gotta go, I gotta go.

GEORGE: No no no. He just left. 

ELAINE: What? 

GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla. 

JERRY: Marla? 

GEORGE: Yeah, I think. You know she was like crying and he was consoling her and then she uh, just got into his car and they just drove away. 

ELAINE: He left with Marla, the virgin? 

GEORGE: Yeah. 

ELAINE: They drove away? 

GEORGE: Yeah, drove away. You know, I said "Hello" to him. You know he's, he's... 

[Jerry moves to the window, shocked]

JERRY: Oh my God in heaven! 

[All three crowd around the window] 

ELAINE: Is that? 

GEORGE: Kramer?! 

[A brief pause] 

ELAINE: He's waving.

[All three wave back] 


[In Elaine's bedroom] 

[Elaine is sound asleep. Scene cuts to George, then Jerry. They too, are sleeping. Scene takes a cut to Kramer and the nudist, both asleep, then a final cut to Marla's bedroom. She's sleeping with JFK Jr.] 

MARLA: Oh John. That was wonderful.
