[Jerry and Kramer are walking down the street at dusk]

KRAMER: Look how dark it's getting already.

JERRY: Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER: When does it start?

JERRY: I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER: Well, I'm sick of waiting.

[He pulls out his pocket watch and changes the time]

KRAMER: I am springing ahead right now.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.

[Jerry sees Mike down the sidewalk. Mike's peering into a shop window]

JERRY: Oh God, it's Mike Moffit.

KRAMER: Oh now don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY: I'm not a phony and I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER: Hey! Mike!

[He signals Mike to come over]

MIKE: Kramer! Jerry! How's it going?!

JERRY: Fine. And I'm not just saying that.

MIKE: Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY: No openings in arson?

MIKE: Either of you guys wanna place a bet, I'm your guy.

KRAMER: Ah no no no. No bets for me. I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY: I'm feeling a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years.

[Jerry leaves]

MIKE: Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER: You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE: Hey, what time you got?

[Kramer pulls out his timepiece]

KRAMER: Oh yes. Uh, it's almost six.

MIKE: Whoa, I'm really late.

[Mike leaves. Kramer puts his watch back in his pocket and starts walking down the street]


[At J. Peterman. Elaine's at work with Peggy. They're looking at Peggy's designs]

ELAINE: Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY: Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman is gonna love them.

[Elaine starts to leave]

PEGGY: Thanks, Susie.

[Elaine goes to the door and turns around, wondering if she heard right and should she say anything. Peggy looks up and pleasantly nods at her, then returns to her work. Elaine wavers and decides to let it drop and leaves]


[At Monk's Cafe]

ELAINE: You won't believe this but as I'm leaving she calls me "Susie."

JERRY: I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE: What am I, a bulimic, chain smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY: Who are you describing?

ELAINE: Someone I know.

JERRY: Named Sharon?

ELAINE: I'd rather not say.

[George has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on]

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Mmm! What's in the bag?

GEORGE: New tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green!

JERRY: Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE: It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY: You taking Allison?

GEORGE: Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe.

JERRY: Live?

ELAINE: Lithe.

GEORGE: Live?

ELAINE: Lithe!

JERRY: Oh, lithe!

ELAINE: Well, you two will have a great time there.

JERRY: It can't be worse than this.

GEORGE: Wait till you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! I'm finally gonna make a great entrance!

ELAINE: Backless? You gonna back her in?

GEORGE: Elaine, when a woman makes a ball entrance she twirls.

[He makes a motion with his hand]

ELAINE: She's not gonna twirl.

GEORGE: She'll twirl.

[Elaine rolls her eyes]


[George and Allison are coming into George's apartment]

GEORGE: That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants everyone to twirl around.

ALLISON: Alright.

GEORGE: Hey! Uh listen, did you get your uh, boss's Knick ticket for Kramer?

ALLISON: Yeah, here.

[She hands him the ticket]

GEORGE: Oh! Great!

ALLISON: Uh, say George...

GEORGE: Whoa! Courtside! Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

ALLISON: George. We need to talk.

GEORGE: What?

ALLISON: I really think we need to talk.

GEORGE: Uh oh.


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: She wants to talk.

GEORGE: She doesn't want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY: Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE: Who would want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY: What'd you do?

GEORGE: I told her I was out of soda. I went out to get some and I never went back.

JERRY: All night?!

GEORGE: Yeah, I slept at my parents house.

JERRY: And she wants to break up with you.

GEORGE: Ha! Can you believe it? I'm supposed to be having lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY: Uh oh. Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's.

GEORGE: So? What am I gonna do?

JERRY: You really like this girl?

GEORGE: No. I like the ball! This is my one chance to make a great entrance! My whole life I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY: You've made some fine exits.

GEORGE: Alright.

JERRY: So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE: Why not? If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still going out, she has to go to the ball.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey. Oh listen, did you get my ticket from Allison?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, right here.

[She hands it to him]

KRAMER: Alright! Yeah, courtside. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away.

[George clips on some shades]

GEORGE: She'll have to find me first.

[George leaves]

KRAMER: Alright. Oh, by the way, you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY: What for?

KRAMER: Well I put a bet down for you on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oh! That's some sweet action!

JERRY: But I don't want any sweet action.

KRAMER: Well, I couldn't do it. I got a gambling problem.

JERRY: So you put down my money?!

KRAMER: You don't have a problem.

JERRY: Not with that, no.


[At J. Peterman. Elaine walks past Peggy's office. Peggy's reading a memo and notices her]

PEGGY: Susie? Susie!

ELAINE: Uh, hi Peggy. Um look, I should have said this yesterday, but...

PEGGY: Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE: Yeah. See that...

PEGGY: You know it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt. She practically ran the company into the ground.

ELAINE: Well, I thought she did a pretty good job.

PEGGY: I heard she was a disaster, Suze.

ELAINE: Look it. It's not Suze. Alright? It's Suzie. My name is Suzie!

[She beats her chest for effect]

[Peggy feels quite threatened]


[George is in his living room watching TV and eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song, "The Greatest American Hero Believe it or not" written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer]

GEORGE: "Believe it or not, George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home." 
[Beep]

[Jerry's on the other end and a little bored. But George likes the song and bobs his head with it]

JERRY: George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: So, coffee shop?

GEORGE: No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure.

[The call waiting beeps]

GEORGE: Hey, I got another call coming in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.

[He hangs up]

GEORGE: "Believe it or not, George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home." 
[Beep]

[George is grooving to it, pantomime-shrugging during it and clicking the remote to another station]

ALLISON: George? Are you there? I hate that stupid message. I know you're avoiding me. I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you.

[She hangs up]

[George dials a number]

GEORGE: Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home. I probably should have tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from you, really looking forward to the ball.

[He hangs up and happily chuckles]


[At Jerry's apartment. Elaine's just arrived]

ELAINE: Can you believe this woman?

JERRY: The nerve. Talking about you behind your back and right to your face!

ELAINE: No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no way I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY: No. No Suze.

ELAINE: I mean, what am I, some pom pom waving backseat bimbo?!

JERRY: Who are you describing?

ELAINE: Someone I know!

JERRY: Named Suze?

ELAINE: No, still Sharon!

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER: No. I was kicked out for fighting with one of the players.

[He leaves]

JERRY: Wait. Way way way way way way wait! Who?!

KRAMER: Reggie Miller.

ELAINE: Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER: Yeah.

[He leaves]

JERRY: Hey hey hey wait, wait wait wait! What happened!

KRAMER: Well, first of all for some reason they started the game an hour late. And uh, I was sitting next to Spike Lee and he and Reggie were jawing at each other, so I guess I got involved.

[He leaves]

ELAINE: Wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa!

JERRY: Well wait wait wait wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER: Well I ran out onto the court and threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." And they threw me and Reggie and Spike out of the game.

ELAINE: So that's it?

KRAMER: Well I, well I felt pretty bad about everything and uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club.

[He leaves]

JERRY: Can you believe that?

ELAINE: I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

[Kramer comes back in]

KRAMER: The Knicks killed them a hundred and ten to seventy three!

JERRY: What, of course without Reggie Miller it's a blowout!

KRAMER: No Jerry, that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cool G, daddy O. Now you gotta let it ride!

JERRY: On what?!

KRAMER: Ah come on, Jerry, I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey, let's go down to the OTB. We'll put some money on the ponies.

[He gets out his pocket watch]

JERRY: Yeah, alright.

KRAMER: Ah! They just closed!

JERRY: Oh. Too bad.


[At Peterman's office. Elaine comes to the door]

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?

PETERMAN: Apparently Peggy down in design got into a little bit of a tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE: Susie?

PETERMAN: Yes. Between you, me and the lamp post and the desk, Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE: It's Susie.

PETERMAN: Nevertheless, Elaine. The House of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and Susie right here in my office.

ELAINE: Ah, all of, all of us?

 
[At Allison's apartment. Someone's knocking on the door and she gets it. It's Kramer]

KRAMER: Allison. Hi. Uh listen, I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen, could I have a ticket tonight because the Rockets are in town and that Hakeem Olajuwon? Oh, he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON: Kramer? Have you seen George around? I can't get a hold of him.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, he uh, visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.

ALLISON: Oh yeah?


[On the street, Jerry is leisurely unloading his groceries from the back of his car]

JERRY: Believe it or not, George isn't at home.

MIKE: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Mike. How about those Knicks?

MIKE: Yeah! How about them? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY: Why not?

MIKE: Because I don't have the money.

JERRY: Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet and then you can't pay? I don't know Mike. To me it sounds a little, how you say, "phony"?

MIKE: Just give me till Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY: You know, you're supposed to be the bookie. Act like one.

MIKE: I'm sorry. Uh, oh here, let me give you a hand with that.

[Mike gets some groceries out of Jerry's trunk]


JERRY: Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE: Oh. Let me see.

[As Mike puts his hands there, Jerry is unaware and shuts the trunk. It happens very fast. Mike's hands are slammed and he screams out in pain]


[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses are at the tables. George is sitting at a table with Kramer]

GEORGE: So ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? And why Pomodoro?

[Just now at one table in the background a Woman is sad and dismayed]

CRYINGWOMAN: How could you say that to me?

KRAMER: Allison spoke to me and um, she wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE: Uh oh.

KRAMER: We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison and I think that the best thing to do is just make a clean break.

GEORGE: Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER: We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE: I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER: So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just a good time.

GEORGE: Are you?

KRAMER: What, me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE: I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER: George, we're sorry. We're through.

GEORGE: Kramer. Please.

KRAMER: I'm sorry.

[He leaves]


[Peterman and Peggy are sitting in his office. There are two empty chairs. The window overlooks central park]

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I guess we should just get this over with.

[She sits]

PETERMAN: Just hold on a minute. Still one short.

ELAINE: Oh no, we're not.

PEGGY: Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN: Well, Elaine has nothing but good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE: Look. We don't have to name names, or point fingers, or name names! Me and her have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I and she and you.

PETERMAN: Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her and her.

ELAINE: Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN: Who?

ELAINE: Her?

PETERMAN: Where is she?!

ELAINE: Ah, this is part of the problem!

PEGGY: I thought I was part of this problem.

ELAINE: You're a huge part of the problem. But I think that at its core, this is a Susie and Elaine problem that requires a Susie and Elaine solution! And who better to do that than... Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN: Well, now that we have that cleared up why don't the three of us have lunch.

[Elaine fakes hearing someone]

ELAINE: What?! Oh! Oh, I'm coming! I, I gotta go.

[She rushes out]

PETERMAN: She is the best. What was your name again?

 
[At Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Jerry are talking. Jerry's eating lunch at his table]

KRAMER: Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY: Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER: Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY: Why is he scared?

KRAMER: Come on in. Did you do this?

[Mike comes in and has two hand casts on]

JERRY: Yeah, but...

KRAMER: Uh ah ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY: It was an accident.

KRAMER: Oh, is that what you call it when somebody doesn't pay up?

MIKE: I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to reach in and take it!

JERRY: I don't want it that way.

KRAMER: Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your trunk, we call it even, and this way nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY: Fine.

MIKE: Oh uh, thank you Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good real good!

[Mike's very grateful and leaves with a two thumbs-up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs-up. That's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER: See that was nice, Jerry. Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY: Ah, it's just a car.

[George comes up and when he and Kramer see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following Jerry sits at the table silently watching, intrigued]

GEORGE: Hi.

KRAMER: Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up. Well they did, but they didn't]

GEORGE: It's, funny running into you here.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. It's funny. You look good.

GEORGE: Do I? Thanks. You too.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. You know, it's getting kind of late. I, I really have to be going, so uh, it's nice seeing you again, alright.

GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah. Hey, hey you, you know maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER: George, it's over. It's just, it's over.

[He leaves]

GEORGE: What do you think, Jerry?

JERRY: I don't know, I just see you guys together.

 
[Outside it's raining. Mike is working on Jerry's trunk trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on]

MIKE: Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out Kramer is getting into his car parked just ahead of Jerry's. He bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time]

MIKE: Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!


[That night, Elaine and Jerry are in the car, talking. He's driving]

JERRY: So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE: Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY: Yeah, I know how you feel.

[Meanwhile, Mike's yelping and banging in the trunk]

ELAINE: Do you hear something?

JERRY: What?

[Meanwhile, Mike, in a now-hoarse voice is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!"]

JERRY: Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE: Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY: Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Get rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE: I kind of like her.

JERRY: She's gone.

ELAINE: Jerry...

JERRY: Gone!

[She starts laughing]

ELAINE: That bumper sticker.

[They both scream and laugh. In the trunk, Mike has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues]

MIKE: Oh God, I'm in trouble.


[George is upset and knocking on Kramer's door]

GEORGE: Kramer. Open up! I know you're in there!

[Kramer opens the door]

KRAMER: Uh George, uh, it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you?

GEORGE: It's only four.

KRAMER: Huh?

GEORGE: I've been walking around all night. I've been thinking about Allison and me and you.

KRAMER: Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE: Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER: Uh, I know I'm gonna regret this. Alright.

GEORGE: Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER: Alright, alright, I'll see you later.

[He shuts the door]

GEORGE: Woo!


[The next day. Elaine's passing by the door of Peterman's office]

PETERMAN: Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE: Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN: Mmm nah.

ELAINE: Alright then, I was gonna wait to tell you this but last night, Susie... she took her own life.

[Peterman grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!" Elaine comforts him]

 
[At Allison's apartment. Kramer knocks and Allison gets it]

KRAMER: We're taking George back.

ALLISON: What?!

KRAMER: He's gonna make us very happy.

[Allison looks doubtful and disappointed]


[At the memorial service. Cars are packed into a small parking lot end to end. Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere]

ELAINE: Look at this turnout.

JERRY: Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE: Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of Peggy who looks like she's seeing a ghost]

PEGGY: Oh my God! Susie?

ELAINE: Oh, oh I'm not Susie. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY: But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE: Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me.

[She's goes to the podium]

PEGGY: I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY: Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.

[He indicates Elaine]

JERRY: Her too.

[Elaine's now at the podium]

ELAINE: What can you say about a girl like Susie?

[She doesn't know]

 
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, Peterman arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment and sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open. Peterman doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, Mike comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk]


[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns and the music is mellow and quiet. George is waiting in a tux for Allison, but Kramer arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly]

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Where's uh, where's Allison?

KRAMER: Oh Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE: But you took me back.

KRAMER: Well yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How do you like the tuxedo? It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. Alright, eh.

GEORGE: Where are you going?

KRAMER: The Ball, silly.

GEORGE: No no no no no. You're not going in there.

KRAMER: George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE: For her. Not for you.

KRAMER: Let's just try and have a nice time for once and we'll talk about this when we get home.

[They start struggling quietly. Kramer's trying to just walk by and George is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention]

GEORGE: Alright, look, wait wait, Kramer wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not going in. Ah!

[George had Kramer in a slightly spinning hold by holding the back of Kramer's tux but the material tore away and this sent Kramer spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well-received by Wilhelm!]

WILHELM: Wow! What an entrance! And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM: Oh. Ah ha.

 
[Meanwhile at the Memorial, Elaine is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful]

ELAINE: And also, much like me, Susie hated going to the market.

PETERMAN: Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE: Oh God yes, Mr. Peterman.

[She steps down]

PETERMAN: Ah. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie. And most of all, I will never forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Just the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was pretty good.

[Jerry leans over to Peggy]

JERRY: Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of them.

[He winks at her]

[Elaine catches Jerry's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up]

PETERMAN: But I never heard her cries for help. And now Susie is gone.

[Mike runs in]

MIKE: Hold on! Hold on! Susie didn't commit suicide!

[He rushes up to podium]

MIKE: She was murdered, by Jerry Seinfeld!

[While Mike's pointing at Jerry and everyone's looking, Jerry looks back at Peggy again]

JERRY: Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[Peggy and Elaine look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment]

 
[After dark, Peterman and Elaine are sitting and talking in his office]

PETERMAN: Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to form a charitable foundation in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman. I'm Susie. She's me.

PETERMAN: I feel the same way. And that's why this foundation will meet around your schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every free moment you have.

[He leaves and pats her shoulders confidently]

[Elaine looks up and screams]

ELAINE: Suze!

[During her screaming up to the air the camera is over her looking down and turning around and around, just like it had when George found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan]
