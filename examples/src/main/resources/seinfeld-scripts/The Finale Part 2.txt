[At Jackie Chiles office]

JACKIECHILES: Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.

[The phone rings]

[Jackie Chiles secretary can be heard on the phone, "Jerry Seinfeld on the phone."]

JACKIECHILES: You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts, right away.


[At Hoyt's office]

HOYT: So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?

[He sets down his newspaper]

HOYT: Uh hmm. You know what that means? This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people and I mean everything.


[The four are in prison, having a meal]

KRAMER: Mmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?

GEORGE: Would it kill him to check up on us? No, drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners but we're still entitled to ketchup!

ELAINE: I guess we could've called for help.

JERRY: But then we would have missed the whole thing.

KRAMER: I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.

GEORGE: Yeah, he's right.

JERRY: I forgot about the video.

ELAINE: Sure, the video.

[Jerry's beeper starts beeping]

ELAINE: What is that?

[Jerry looks at the beeper]

JERRY: Plane's ready.


[The Rivera Live news show]

RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane?

WELLS: Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.

RIVERA: What's the mood? What's going on tonight?

WELLS: Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.

RIVERA: And what about the defendants, the so called New York Four. How are they holding up?

WELLS: Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."

RIVERA: Anything else, Jane?

WELLS: There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated and it's possible that ended badly.

RIVERA: Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.


[Jerry's parents are packing]

HELEN: I hope you packed enough. This trial could last for weeks.

MORTY: What's all that?

HELEN: Cereal.

MORTY: You're packing cereal?

HELEN: I'm bringing it for Jerry.

MORTY: You got enough here for a life sentence.

HELEN: He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.

MORTY: So bring a snack pack.


[George's parents are packing]

ESTELLE: Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.

FRANK: Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.

ESTELLE: Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours?

FRANK: You were the one who smothered him!

ESTELLE: I did not smother him!

FRANK: You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!

ESTELLE: Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.

FRANK: I had to make a living!


[Newman is laughing. He leaves his building with a suitcase. Uncle Leo leaves with his bags, followed by J. Peterman, David Puddy in his 8-ball jacket, Mickey, Kenny Bania, Mr. and Mrs. Ross, Mr. Bookman, Keith Hernandez, and George Steinbrenner]


[The four are at a table. Jerry and Kramer are enjoying some cereal while they wait for Jackie Chiles]

KRAMER: This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk because I know we gotta make it last.

JERRY: You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters, sometimes to the top of the cereal. Now to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.

KRAMER: I bet.

JERRY: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

[Jackie Chiles enters]

JACKIECHILES: Good morning.

ELAINE: Good morning, Jackie.

JERRY: Good morning.

JACKIECHILES: Is everybody ready?

[He looks at George]

JACKIECHILES: Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?

GEORGE: It makes me look older.

JACKIECHILES: Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.

[Jerry laughs]

JACKIECHILES: Do you think it's funny?

JERRY: No.

JACKIECHILES: You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Because if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.

ELAINE: How do I look, Jackie?

JACKIECHILES: Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine looking sexy lady.

ELAINE: Thank you, Jackie.

KRAMER: How about me, Jackie?

JACKIECHILES: Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.

[Jackie hands Jerry a tie]

JACKIECHILES: Here.

JERRY: This one?

JACKIECHILES: That's right.

JERRY: Do I have to?

ELAINE: Jackie says put it on, Jerry.


[The court is starting]

BAILIFF: All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding.

GEORGE: Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?

JACKIECHILES: Vanda who?

GEORGE: Jerry, did you hear that?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: I think that's a good sign.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?

HOYT: We are, Your Honor.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Mr. Hoyt.

HOYT: Ladies and gentlemen, last year our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.

[Newman is shown eating popcorn]

JUDGEVANDELAY: Mr. Chiles.

JACKIECHILES: I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing, lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocent bystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know they were bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal, the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?

HOYT: We are, your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.

BAILIFF: Call Matt Vogel.

[Hoyt questions officer Vogel]

HOYT: So they were just standing there?

OFFICERVOGEL: Yes.

HOYT: Did one of them have a video camera?

OFFICERVOGEL: Yes.

HOYT: Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Proceed.

[The tape plays]

FATGUY: Don't shoot.

JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.

ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!

GEORGE: He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.


[The victim of the robbery takes the stand]

HOYT: So they just stood there and did nothing?

FATGUY: Yeah, nothing. Nothing!

HOYT: No further questions.

[NBC executives Stu Chermak and Jay Crespi enter the court]

GEORGE: Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!

HOYT: Call Mabel Choate to the stand.

BAILIFF: Call Mabel Choate.

JACKIECHILES: Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.

HOYT: Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses. It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.

[Hoyt questions Mabel Choate]

HOYT: Now Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January fourth.

MABELCHOATE: Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.

[She points at Jerry]

HOYT: Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld. What did he want?

MABELCHOATE: My marble rye.

HOYT: Your marble rye?

MABELCHOATE: I got the last one. He kept persisting and I said no.

HOYT: And then you left the bakery.

MABELCHOATE: That's right.

HOYT: But it didn't end there, did it Mrs. Choate?

MABELCHOATE: Oh no.

[Flash-back from past episode, "The Rye"]

JERRY: Give me that rye.

MABELCHOATE: Stop it.

JERRY: I want that rye lady.

[They struggle over the marble rye]

MABELCHOATE: Help! Someone help!

JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!

[Jerry takes the rye and runs away]

[Back to the courtroom]

HOYT: No further questions.


[Hoyt questions Marla Penny]

HOYT: I call Marla Penny to the stand.

BAILIFF: Call Marla Penny.

JERRY: The virgin!

HOYT: And what was your connection to the defendants?

MARLA: I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of nineteen ninety-two.

HOYT: Then on the evening of October twenty-eighth there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.

MARLA: It's rather difficult to talk about.

HOYT: It's alright. Take your time.

MARLA: Well, I became aware of a...

HOYT: A what?

MARLA: A uh...

HOYT: Yes?

MARLA: A contest.

[The four defendants bow their heads and squirm in their seats]

HOYT: Contest?

MARLA: Yes.

HOYT: What was the nature of the contest?

MARLA: Oh please, I can't.

HOYT: It's okay.

MARLA: The four of them made a wager to see if they could...

HOYT: Yes?

MARLA: To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.

[The courtroom erupts in shock]

PETERMAN: For the love of God!

MARLA: It was horrible, horrible!


[Hoyt calls the Bubble Boy to the stand]

HOYT: Call Donald Sanger to the stand.

JERRY: Who the hell is that?

MEL: Come on Donald, you're doing fine.

[He leads Donald into the court]

GEORGE: The Bubble Boy!

JACKIECHILES: Bubble Boy?

JERRY: That's right, the Bubble Boy.

JACKIECHILES: What's a Bubble Boy?

JERRY: He's a boy who lives in a bubble.

BUBBLEBOY: What the hell are all you looking at?

[Hoyt questions the bubble boy]

HOYT: So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October seventh, nineteen ninety-two.

BUBBLEBOY: Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.

[Flash-back from past episode, "The Bubble Boy"]

GEORGE: Who invaded Spain in the eighth century?

BUBBLEBOY: That's a joke, the Moors.

GEORGE: Oh no, I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: Moops? Let me see that.

[He takes the card from George and reads it]

BUBBLEBOY: That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.

[George takes the card back and puts it back in the stack]

GEORGE: Sorry, the card says Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: It doesn't matter. It's Moors, there's no Moops.

GEORGE: It's Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: Moors!

[George stands up from his chair]

GEORGE: Moops!

[The bubble boy grabs George around the neck]

GEORGE: Help! Someone!

BUBBLEBOY: There's no Moops, you idiot.

SUSAN: Stop it! Let go of him!

MRSSANGER: Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it.

[A loud hissing sound can be heard and Donald slowly retracts his hands from around George's neck. George waves bye-bye to Donald]

[Back to the court]

GEORGE: It was Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: Moors.


[The lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in "The Handicapped Spot" takes the stand]

HOYT: So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?

LULA: That's right.

HOYT: And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?

LULA: That's right.

[Flash-back showing Lula screaming and going out of control down a hill in her wheelchair]


[Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died takes the stand]

HOYT: So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?

DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. It was May sixteenth, nineteen ninety-six. I'll never forget it.

HOYT: So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?

DOCTOR: I would describe it as restrained jubilation.

MRROSS: Murderer!

MRSROSS: He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!

JUDGEVANDELAY: Order in this court!


[Hoyt calls Sidra to the stand]

HOYT: Call Sidra Holland to the stand.

[Sidra slinks to the stand wearing a low cut dress]

JACKIECHILES: Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?

[Hoyt questions Sidra on the stand]

HOYT: So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in nineteen ninety-three?

SIDRA: Yes.

HOYT: And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?

SIDRA: Yes, that's true.

HOYT: Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.

SIDRA: We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.

[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Implant"]

[Elaine and Sidra are in the steam room at the health club]

SIDRA: You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra.

[She removes her towel]

SIDRA: This is Marcie.

ELAINE: Oh hi, I'm Elaine.

[Elaine gets up to shake her hand and falls right into Sidra's breasts]

[Back in the courtroom]

HOYT: So, she pretended to trip and she fell into your breasts?

SIDRA: Yes.

HOYT: Why would she do something like that?

SIDRA: Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.


[Mr. Bookman, library cop takes the stand]

HOYT: State your name.

BOOKMAN: Bookman, Joe Bookman.

HOYT: And what's your occupation?

BOOKMAN: I'm a library cop.

HOYT: What does a library cop do?

BOOKMAN: We chase down library delinquents.

HOYT: Anyone in this room ever delinquent?

BOOKMAN: Yeah, he was. Right over there, Seinfeld.

HOYT: How long was his book overdue?

BOOKMAN: Twenty-five years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.

HOYT: What do you call them?

BOOKMAN: Criminals.


[Robin, George's old girlfriend from "The Fire" takes the stand]

HOYT: So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.

ROBIN: Yes.

HOYT: And then what happened?

ROBIN: Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and...

[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Fire"]

[George runs out of a kitchen when he discovers a fire]

GEORGE: Fire! Get out of the way!

[In the process of exiting the room, George knocks over several kids and one old lady on a walker]


[A parking lot security guard takes the stand]

PARKINGLOTSECURITYGUARD: At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.

[Flash-back from past episode, "The Parking Garage"]

JERRY: Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.

PARKINGLOTSECURITYGUARD: I don't know.

JERRY: Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die, that's why.

[Back to the courtroom]

HOYT: Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!

JACKIECHILES: Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of nineteen ninety.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Sit down, Mr. Chiles.


[A Police Detective takes the stand]

HOYT: Alright Detective, then what happened?

DETECTIVE: We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.

[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Wig Master"]

[Kramer, who happens to be dressed like a pimp, is arguing with a prostitute he found in his car]

PROSTITUTE: You just cost me some money!

[She whacks Kramer with her purse]

KRAMER: Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.

[They start to struggle with each other. Suddenly a light shines in their eyes]

POLICE: Police officers, freeze right there!

[Back to the courtroom]

HOYT: So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.

[Detective shacks his head "yes"]


[The low-talker from "The Puffy Shirt" takes the stand]

HOYT: So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?

LESLIE: [Starts to mumble a few words]

[The entire court leans forward trying to hear what she has to say]

HOYT: Excuse me?

JACKIECHILES: Uh, excuse me, your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there or let's move on.


[George Steinbrenner takes the stand]

HOYT: Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.

BAILIFF: Call George Steinbrenner.

HOYT: So George Costanza came to work for you in May of nineteen ninety-four?

STEINBRENNER: Yes, that's right. He was good kid, a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me, that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it Georgie?

GEORGE: Yes sir, that was a good sandwich sir.

STEINBRENNER: He had one little problem though.

HOYT: What was that?

STEINBRENNER: He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.

FRANK: How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!

JUDGEVANDELAY: Order!


[Marcelino from "The Little Jerry" takes the stand]

HOYT: Cock fighting?

MARCELINO: Cock fighting.


[The Pharmacist from "The Sponge" takes the stand]

SPONGEPHARMACIST: Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them.

[The court gasps]


[Elaine's old boyfriend Fred from work takes the stand]

FRED: She exposed her nipple.


[Mr. Pitt takes the stand]

HOYT: How did she try to kill you?

MRPITT: She tried to smother me with a pillow.


[The Soup Nazi takes the stand]

HOYT: Call Yev Kassem to the stand.

BAILIFF: Call Yev Kassem.

JERRY: Who?

[The doors in the rear of the courtroom open to show the Soup Nazi standing there]

ELAINE: The Soup Nazi!

JACKIECHILES: Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.

[The Soup Nazi takes the stand]

HOYT: State your name.

SOUPNAZI: Yev Kassem.

HOYT: Could you spell that?

SOUPNAZI: No! Next question.

HOYT: How do you know the defendants?

SOUPNAZI: They used to come to my restaurant.

[Flash-Back to "The Soup Nazi" episode]

[George and Jerry are at a soup stand ordering their soups]

GEORGE: Medium turkey chili.

[George puts his money on the counter and slides over to the cashier]

JERRY: Medium crab bisque.

[The cashier hands George his soup]

GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.

JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.

GEORGE: Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.

SOUPNAZI: You want bread?

GEORGE: Yes, please.

SOUPNAZI: Three dollars!

GEORGE: What?

SOUPNAZI: No soup for you!

[The cashier snatches the soup away from George]

[Back in the courtroom]

SOUPNAZI: But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one, the woman, for a year. Then one day, she came back.

[Flash-Back to the "Soup Nazi" episode]

[Elaine is reading from some papers to the Soup Nazi]

ELAINE: Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.

SOUPNAZI: That's my recipe for wild mushroom!

ELAINE: You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!

[Back in the courtroom]

SOUPNAZI: She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!

ELAINE: Soup's not all that good anyway.

[He rises from his seat]

SOUPNAZI: What did you say?!


[Hoyt calls Babu Bhatt to the stand]

HOYT: The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.

JERRY: How did they find Babu?

ELAINE: I thought he was deported.

[Once again the doors in the rear of the courtroom open to show Babu standing there. He walks slowly to the front and takes the stand]

HOYT: You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?

BABU: Yes, all the way from Pakistan.

HOYT: And what's your connection to the defendant?

BABU: I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But nobody came! There were no people.

HOYT: And then what happened?

BABU: Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me, just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice. Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad! Very, very, very bad!

[Babu waves his long index finger back and forth several times]


[Rivera Live]

RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane?

WELLS: Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.

RIVERA: That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.

WELLS: Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.

RIVERA: Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?

WELLS: That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury. There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on and on and on into the night.

RIVERA: And so we wait.


[The group is waiting for the jury to decide]

JERRY: Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?

ELAINE: I think so.

JERRY: It's not that bright orange one is it?

ELAINE: I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.

KRAMER: Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?


[George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay]

ESTELLE: Sorry to bother you, Judge.

JUDGEVANDELAY: How did you get in here?

ESTELLE: Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.

JUDGEVANDELAY: This is highly irregular.

ESTELLE: Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.

JUDGEVANDELAY: What do you mean?

ESTELLE: You know.


[Slow music with a harmonica starts playing]

[Several different shots of witnesses waiting at the court, in a pool hall, at a restaurant, etc. Buddy is outside on the grass, holding a reflective mirror to sun his face. Mr. Steinbrenner is arguing with a waiter. Newman is lying in the back of a car eating chips. The Soup Nazi is serving soup to several people in a restaurant on a porch. Poppie motions to the Soup Nazi that he needs a salt shaker. The Soup Nazi responds by taking the soup away from him and then his spoon also. Mr. Ross is in a pawn shop buying a gun. He holds it, thinking to himself]


[Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles are in bed]

SIDRA: Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.

JACKIECHILES: We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.

[The phone rings]

JACKIECHILES: Hello? Damn. They're ready.


[Back in the courtroom]

JERRY: Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?

ELAINE: I've always loved... United Airlines.

[The Jury reenters the courtroom]

KRAMER: I think it's going to be okay, that girl just smiled at me.

JERRY: Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.

BAILIFF: All rise.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

FOREWOMAN: We have, your Honor.

JUDGEVANDELAY: Will the defendants please rise.

[Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer rise from their seats]

JUDGEVANDELAY: And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?

FOREWOMAN: We find the defendants...

[She turns to look at them]

FOREWOMAN: Guilty.

[The courtroom erupts in cheers]

JUDGEVANDELAY: Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of you to spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.

[Judge Vandelay leaves]

GEORGE: You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.

ELAINE: Puddy, don't wait for me.

PUDDY: Alright.

[Frank is shaking Estelle, who has passed out]

FRANK: We gotta get out of here! We want to beat the traffic!

SIDRA: Come on, Jackie. Let's go.

JERRY: What?

JACKIECHILES: Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.


[The group is walking back to the holding cell]

JERRY: Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year and then we'll be back

KRAMER: Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show. Maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady." Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.

ELAINE: Why don't you just blow it out your...

[They enter the cell]

ELAINE: If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: Because you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.

JERRY: I think that would be a very nice gesture.

[Kramer starts banging the side of his head and jumping up and down on one foot]

KRAMER: I got it, it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.

JERRY: See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no man's land.

GEORGE: Haven't we had this conversation before?

JERRY: You think?

GEORGE: I think we have.

JERRY: Yeah, maybe we have.

[The camera slowly recedes from their cell]


[Epilogue, on stage in the prison]

JERRY: So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?

PRISONERONE: I am.

JERRY: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding. I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for, sir?

PRISONERTWO: Murder one.

JERRY: Murder one? Oh, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir, lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?

PRISONERTHREE: Grand theft auto.

JERRY: Grand theft auto, don't steal any of my jokes.

PRISONERTHREE: You suck. I'm gonna cut you.

JERRY: Hey, I don't come down to where you work and knock the license plate out of your hand.

PRISONGUARD: Alright Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.

JERRY: Alright, hey you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
