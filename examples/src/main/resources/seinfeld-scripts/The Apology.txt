[At Jerry's apartment. He's making waffles for his girlfriend]

JERRY: Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.

[Melissa appears in the kitchen stark naked]

MELISSA:  Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.

[Jerry looks at her]

JERRY: How about that.

[Melissa eats her waffle]

MELISSA: Mmm hmm.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: She ate breakfast naked?

JERRY: She didn't even want a napkin.

GEORGE: I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk to the bathroom naked. I have never had living room naked.

JERRY: Oh, it's a scene.

GEORGE: It's like you're living in the Playboy Mansion! Did she uh, did she frolic?

JERRY: I don't really have enough room.

[Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's]

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey Lainey, Puddy.

ELAINE: Hey!

PUDDY: Hi.

JERRY: Hey.

PUDDY: I got to make a pit stop.

ELAINE: Okay.

JERRY: Back together?

ELAINE: His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.

JERRY: Ah.

ELAINE: So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.

GEORGE: Stanky Hanke? What did he want?

ELAINE: He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.

JERRY: Why now?

ELAINE: A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.

GEORGE: Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.

JERRY: Still with the neck hole?

GEORGE: Still upset. Very upset.

ELAINE: What neck hole?

GEORGE: Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.

[Elaine is becoming bored]

ELAINE: Faster.

GEORGE: I asked if I could borrow a sweater.

JERRY: A cashmere sweater.

GEORGE: I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party he says, "No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole."

[Elaine laughs]

GEORGE: Oh yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!

ELAINE: Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it because of your neck?

JERRY: No, I think the head does most of the stretching.

GEORGE: Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap MetLife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.

ELAINE: I really think it's the size of your neck.

GEORGE: It's my head!

[Elaine laughs]


[In the woman's bathroom at J. Peterman]

ELAINE: Hey.

PEGGY: Hey.

ELAINE: Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.

PEGGY: Yeah. Great.

[Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet]


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: You went to the coffee shop without me? I told you I just wanted to hop in the shower.

JERRY: That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?

KRAMER: Showering. How long does it take you?

JERRY: Ten minutes.

KRAMER: Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?

ELAINE: Ten minutes.

KRAMER: Let me smell you.

ELAINE: Alright. Whiff away.

[Kramer delicately sniffs Elaine]

KRAMER: Uh, that's not bad at all.

[Kramer tries again but Elaine will have none of it]

ELAINE: Hup! That's it.

KRAMER: Okay.

ELAINE: So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today and I see Peggy using a seat protector.

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: So? We're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would, would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?

[Jerry sees Kramer struggle to open a soda and spill it all over]

JERRY: I think the damage is probably already done.

[He interrupts Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda]

JERRY: Alright! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.

ELAINE: Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.

JERRY: Mmm.

KRAMER: Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap and just focus!


[At Jerry's apartment, later]

[He's playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend]

JERRY: Zephyr? That is not a word.

MELISSA: Do you challenge?

JERRY: No, I do not challenge.

MELISSA: Sixty-six points. Ha ha.

JERRY: I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.

MELISSA: You want some more ice tea?

JERRY: Sure.

[She coughs loudly while Jerry's expression turns to disgust]

MELISSA: Wrong pipe.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: So she coughed.

JERRY: Coughing naked. It's a turn off, man.

GEORGE: Everything goes with naked.

JERRY: When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.

GEORGE: Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?

JERRY: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good. Naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.

GEORGE: Alright, it's grovel time.

HANKE: Hey George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps.

GEORGE: What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?

HANKE: Yeah. Making amends.

GEORGE: Important step. Maybe the most important.

HANKE: Anyway uh, Jerry, you know this may sound dumb, but you know when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times and I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so I'm sorry.

JERRY: Thank you. I did notice and I appreciate you rectifying it.

HANKE: Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later.


[At Jerry's apartment. Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Well, I just got out of a twenty-seven minute shower. I made some good cuts and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.

JERRY: You got some suds over here.

KRAMER: What? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.

JERRY: Oh, come on!

KRAMER: No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!

JERRY: You promise you'll never come in here again?

KRAMER: Oh Jerry, you know I can't do that.


[In Jerry's bathroom]

JERRY: Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.

KRAMER: Well, that's how cats do it.

JERRY: But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.

KRAMER: Okay. Let's turn the water on now.

JERRY: No, I told you, it's just a dry run.

[George enters the bathroom]

GEORGE: Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.

JERRY: That's Step Ten?

GEORGE: All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?

KRAMER: Come on, Jerry. How about a baggy swimsuit?

JERRY: You're not getting any skin, Kramer.

KRAMER: Well, this has all been one big tease!


[At Peterman's meeting]

[Elaine moves Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk]

ELAINE: These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.

PEGGY: I'm gonna get another bottle of water.

WALTER: Here, take mine. There's a little left.

PEGGY: Oh thanks, Walter. Ah!

[She gulps down Walter's water]


[At Monk's Cafe]

HANKE: Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.

GREG: You get pretty buff forearms.

HANKE: I don't know if I'm into that.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Oh, hello Hanke, others.

HANKE: George.

GEORGE: You know Jason, I uh, I couldn't help notice, I, I didn't get my apology.

HANKE: Apology? For what?

GEORGE: A drafty apartment? A sweaterless friend? A ball game giveaway MetLife windbreaker?

HANKE: George, come on, not that neck hole thing.

GEORGE: Yeah, the neck hole thing and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.

HANKE: No way, you would've completely stretched it out.

GEORGE: You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.

HANKE: Alright George, alright. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.


[At the YMCA]

[Kramer is watching the men take their showers and is taking notes]

KRAMER: Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.

MAN: Hey!

KRAMER: Oh, yeah yeah, I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Kramer walks in with a black eye]

KRAMER: You got a steak?

JERRY: What happened to you?

KRAMER: Ah, people in this city are crazy.

JERRY: Here you go.

[Kramer applies the steak to his eye]

KRAMER: Thanks buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1? Because I'm cooking a steak.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, a different one.

JERRY: Oh!

[Jerry closes the door on him]

KRAMER: Jerry!


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Melissa wheels out Jerry's bicycle]

MELISSA: Okay Jerry, I fixed that bike.

JERRY: Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.

MELISSA: I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.

JERRY: Please don't crouch.

MELISSA: Ouch! Caught my skin.

JERRY: Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.

MELISSA: You got anything to snack on?

JERRY: Uh...

[She grabs the pickle jar and strains to open it]

MELISSA: Oh, pickles! Uh! It's a tough one.

JERRY: Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!

MELISSA: Uh! Oh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.

JERRY: I can't. I can't look anymore. I, I, I've seen too much.


[At Peggy's Office]

ELAINE: Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?

PEGGY: You seem to be with a lot of men.

ELAINE: What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but why is this your business?

PEGGY: It's not. Good day.

ELAINE: Oh. Alright. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh?

[She rubs the keyboard on herself]

ELAINE: Huh? Oh, how about for your stapler. Hmm?

[She puts the stapler in her armpit and staples it]
ELAINE: That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.

[Peggy is shocked and looks disgusted]


[At Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: Well, technically he did apologize.

GEORGE: Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!

JERRY: So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?

GEORGE: That's right. I'm two in the hole!

JERRY: Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.

GEORGE: Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?

JERRY: Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?

GEORGE: Well, what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Well, you on all fours, that thing vibrating, kicking up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Hello?

KRAMER: Hey Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!

JERRY: World War I plane?

KRAMER: No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner and then I ask myself, "Why?" I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.

JERRY: When are you getting out?

KRAMER: I'm not! I'll see you later, buddy.


[At the Peterman meeting]

PETERMAN: Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.

ELAINE: Oh, please.

PETERMAN: She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.

ELAINE: Oh come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?

PETERMAN: I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.

ELAINE: Yeah, let me tell you something, this is all in her mind, okay? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?

ALAN: Sponsor.

GEORGE: Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.

ALAN: He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.

GEORGE: Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.

ALAN: Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?

GEORGE: I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology he was bebopping and scatting all over me.

ALAN: I'm not sure what you want me to do.

GEORGE: Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years because I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.

ALAN: You're quite upset, George.

GEORGE: Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.

ALAN: Admit there's a higher power?

GEORGE: Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.

ALAN: You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?

GEORGE: Alright. That's more like it. Thank you very much.

[He gives the sponsor the "be strong" hand clench]

GEORGE: By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...


[In Kramer's shower. He's on the phone]

KRAMER: Lomez, you're not listening. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call you back.


[At Jerry's apartment. Melissa is naked on the couch]

MELISSA: What are you doing?

[Jerry comes out naked with a belt sander]

JERRY: I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.

MELISSA: No, not that. Why are you naked?

JERRY: I thought naked is good.

MELISSA: This isn't good naked.


[At the Rageaholics meeting]

SPONSER: George, here, have a seat.

GEORGE: Where's Hanke?

SPONSER: Shh.

SPONSER: Okay, let's get started. Welcome to Rageaholics Anonymous.

GEORGE: What? Rageaholics?

SPONSER: George, this can help you.

GEORGE: Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.

SPONSER: Excuse me. We have a "no yelling" policy at these meetings.

GEORGE: Excuse me! Am I talking to you, Pinhead?! Am I?!

SPONSER: Please don't call me "Pinhead".

GEORGE: I'm losing it!


[At Monk's Cafe]

JERRY: He took you to Rageaholics? Why?

GEORGE: Probably because this whole Universe is against me!

JERRY: You've got a little rage.

GEORGE: I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!

JERRY: By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.

GEORGE: This bread has nuts in it!

JERRY: Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?

ELAINE: Chicken wing shoulder blades.

JERRY: That's it?

ELAINE: No, but that's one problem. Why?

JERRY: Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day...

ELAINE: Whoa! Walking around naked? Ah, that is not a good look for a man.

GEORGE: Why not? It's a good look for a woman.

ELAINE: Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for getting around, like a jeep.

JERRY: So you don't think it's attractive?

ELAINE: It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.

GEORGE: Well, some women like it.

ELAINE: Hmm. Sickies.


[Kramer is in the shower reading an instruction manual]

KRAMER: Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh come on, Clarkman.


[At Elaine's apartment. The phone rings]

PUDDY: Puddy.

KRAMER: Is uh, David Puddy there?

PUDDY: This is Puddy.

KRAMER: Well, this is Kramer.

PUDDY: I know.

KRAMER: Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?

PUDDY: Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.

KRAMER: No. It says "main line".

PUDDY: It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?

KRAMER: Yeah.

PUDDY: Hey man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.

KRAMER: Oh, okay. Well, thanks, buddy.

ELAINE: Hey, Puddy.

PUDDY: Hey babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.

ELAINE: Balloon bouquet? For who?

PUDDY: Peggy took a turn for the worst.

ELAINE: Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?

PUDDY: That's what he said.

ELAINE: I don't believe this woman.

PUDDY: Talk to me, babe.

ELAINE: She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.

PUDDY: Oh, germophobe. I know what that's about.

ELAINE: Huh?

PUDDY: I'm a recovering germophobe. Ten years.

ELAINE: What is this symbol?

PUDDY: It's a germ.


[At Peggy's]

PEGGY: Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.

PUDDY: Don't you? Elaine.

[Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy]

PEGGY: Please!

PUDDY: I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.

PEGGY: Really?

PUDDY: I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.

ELAINE: Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.

PUDDY: They're bacteria traps.

PEGGY: So you... just learned to live with it?

PUDDY: For the most part.

ELAINE: Okay, we're broken up for the rest of the day.


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?

MELISSA: This is nice.

JERRY: Yes, clothes. This is normal.

MELISSA: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down...

[As Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously naked and stops paying attention]

MELISSA: Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?

JERRY: Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.

MELISSA: I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.

JERRY: Oh, maybe a haircut and, I don't know, maybe a...

[As Jerry continues to talk, Melissa starts imagining him disgustingly "neanderthalishly" naked and stops paying attention]


[Kramer is in the shower talking to Jerry on the phone]

KRAMER: So you broke up?

JERRY: We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.

KRAMER: Hang on.

[Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub]

JERRY: So what are you up to?

KRAMER: Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?

JERRY: Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.

KRAMER: No problem there.


[At Baskin Robbins]

HANKE: George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday.

GEORGE: Well, I'm here. What is it?

HANKE: Well, I talked to my sponsor and uh, I've thought it over and you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic and rude and you deserve much better.

GEORGE: Well, thank you.

HANKE: You're welcome.

[A kid enters the store]

KID: Can I get a triple minute man mint?

HANKE: Waffle or sugar cone?

GEORGE: Uh, excuse me uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.

HANKE: What?

KID: Can you get on that cone?

HANKE: Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?

GEORGE: Well, it's just all you said was "your welcome" which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.

KID: Is there anybody else here but you?

HANKE: I'm alone and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, okay? You know I, I admitted I was wrong so what more do you want from me?

GEORGE: I would like an apology.

HANKE: Alright, look, you know...

KIDSFRIEND: Did you try it?

KID: No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.

HANKE: Oh, yes I do. Yes I do. Okay? I'm interacting with someone here if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Bah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again and tell it to me.

HANKE: I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daiquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!


[At Elaine's apartment. Elaine is eating dinner with Kramer, Puddy, and Peggy]

ELAINE: Mmm. This food is fantastic.

PEGGY: And what a pretty radish rose, huh?

KRAMER: Well, thank you.

ELAINE: Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ free, free.

[They all make a toast]

KRAMER: Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.

[They all make another toast]

PEGGY: You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.

ELAINE: This food was in the shower with you?

KRAMER: Mmm hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.

[Peggy, Elaine, and Puddy all gag and wretch]

PUDDY: Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!


[At the Germophobe meeting]

GEORGE: Excuse me. Is this uh, Rageaholics?

PUDDY: No, germophobe.

GEORGE: Thanks. What are you guys doing here?

ELAINE: Kramer.

GEORGE: Right.


[At the Rageaholics meeting]

HANKE: Hi, I'm uh, Jason. I'm a rageaholic.

[The audience responds, "Hi, Jason."]

HANKE: Uh, this is my first meeting.

GEORGE: Step skipper. That man is a step skipper! He skips Step Nine!

HANKE: Please. Step Nine.

GEORGE: That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.

[The audience laughs]

GEORGE: It wasn't funny.

HANKE: It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.

GEORGE: He's bebopping and scatting and I'm losing it!
