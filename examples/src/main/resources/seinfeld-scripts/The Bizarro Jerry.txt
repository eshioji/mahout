[Jerry and George are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo]

JERRY: Alright, how about this one. Let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE: Fine.

JERRY: They haul you aboard the mothership, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo or their circus?

GEORGE: I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE: I'm wearing a little hat, I'm jumping through fire. They're putting their little alien heads in my mouth.

JERRY: At least its show business.

GEORGE: But in the zoo, you know, they might put a woman in there with me to uh, you know, get me to mate.

JERRY: What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE: Then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

 
[In an office building]

KRAMER: George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE: Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: He knows.

GEORGE: On the left, exquisite marble! High ceilings. And a flush like a jet engine! 
[He imitates the sound]

GEORGE: Ha ha!

KRAMER: Now listen, uh, you better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE: You sure?

JERRY: He knows.

[Kramer goes on his mission while they wait for the elevator. A receptionist calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model]

GEORGE: Wow. Nice.

JERRY: Why don't you try your engagement story?

[George considers it, then goes into the elevator]

GEORGE: Won't work.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GEORGE: He knows.


[At Reggie's diner. Elaine and Kevin, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. Elaine is a little bored, dreading]

ELAINE: Look Kevin, I really like you. But um, maybe we'd be better off just being... friends.

KEVIN: Friends?

ELAINE: Well. I mean. Oh God, this tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN: Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you and Jerry!

 
[In the men's room. A flush sound and "Woo!"]


[Down the hall, a man in a suit is trying to use the copier as Kramer comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance]

COPIERMAN: Damn thing is jammed again.

KRAMER: You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on them. 
[He hits a button several times and whacks it]

WORRIEDMAN: Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

COPIERMAN: Come on, let's go.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah.

[He follows them]

 
[At Monk's Cafe. George, Jerry, and Elaine are at a booth]

ELAINE: Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY: I don't know, do you have a...

[Elaine has anticipated the question and gives him her picture]

JERRY: Not bad. What, what does she...

ELAINE: I put her stats on the back.

JERRY: Pretty impressive. Serious boyfriend ninety-two to ninety-five. Owns her own car. Favorite president: James Polk!

GEORGE: Hmm! Let me see that.

JERRY: So how did it go with Kevin? Did you steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE: You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY: Why would anybody want a friend?

ELAINE: Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY: I mean all that stuff is so small... stupid.

GEORGE: You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this was my fiancee

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Don't you see. Women like that are like members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE: Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were getting close and now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city.

GEORGE: Can I keep this?

ELAINE: No, I need it.

GEORGE: Thanks.

[He absently leaves with it]

 
[At the Brand-Leland office reception area. George comes in off the elevator to the receptionist Amanda]

GEORGE: Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay.

AMANDA: I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here.

[He takes out his wallet]

GEORGE: Well, let me. Heh. Let me just uh, check and make sure I have the right man, ha! Seems, oh! I, oh!

[George conveniently drops the photo into her view]

AMANDA: Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE: Well, if you must know, she was my fiancee, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA: Oh, sorry. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

[They shake hands]

GEORGE: I'm George.

[As they continue talking a man and Kramer go to the elevator]

WORKINGMAN: Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

WORKINGMAN: Heh heh!

KRAMER: You want a drink? I'm buying.

WORKINGMAN: In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up and get on the elevator]


[At a restaurant. Jerry and Gillian meet]

GILLIAN: Jerry?

JERRY: Gillian. Hi.

GILLIAN: Very nice to meet you.

JERRY: It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's. Nice enough, but big and beefy]


[At Monk's Cafe. Jerry and Elaine are in a booth]

JERRY: She had man hands.

ELAINE: Man hands?

JERRY: The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology. I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE: Would you prefer it if she had no hands at all?

JERRY: Would she have hooks?

ELAINE: Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY: Kind of cool looking.

ELAINE: Uh listen, you're picking me up from my place tomorrow.

JERRY: Yeah yeah.

ELAINE: Okay, I've got five huge boxes of buttons.

JERRY: Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call.

ELAINE: Jerry!


[At Jerry's apartment. A tea kettle is whistling. Kramer's cooking breakfast as Jerry comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. Kramer's wearing a suit and oven mitts]

JERRY: Kramer?!

KRAMER: Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY: It's eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is going on?!

KRAMER: Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand-Leland by nine.

JERRY: Why??

KRAMER: Because I'm working there, that's why.

JERRY: How long have I been asleep? What, what year is this?

KRAMER: Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting aimlessly?

JERRY: Now that you mention it.

KRAMER: But I finally realized what's missing in my life. Structure. And at Brand-Leland I'm getting things done. And I love the people I'm working with.

JERRY: How much are they paying you?

KRAMER: Oh, no no no no, I don't want any pay. I'm doing this just for me.

JERRY: Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER: T C B. You know, taking care of business. Ah, I gotta go.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: I'll see you tonight, huh?

[He turns back and grabs his briefcase]

KRAMER: Forgot my briefcase.

JERRY: What you got in there?

KRAMER: Crackers.

[Music (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train Nine to Five") accompanies assorted shots of working-man Kramer getting on the subway while everyone else is going the opposite direction. Washing his shoes at the water cooler. Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase. Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF-type restaurant]

 
[Jerry is at home on the phone. George is on the other end]

JERRY: So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE: Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY: I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE: Right. Bye.

[Elaine comes in, appalled, shrugging at Jerry. He doesn't know why so shrugs back]

ELAINE: Where were you today?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Pick. Up.

JERRY: Damn.

ELAINE: So? Where were you?!

JERRY: Uh, here I guess, and uh, I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE: I had to ask Kevin to leave his office and come and pick me up!

JERRY: So? What are friends for?

ELAINE: Yeah! And he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY: So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE: Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is down. Down is up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE: Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY: No. It's still a goodbye.

ELAINE: Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Is he black?

JERRY: Look. Just forget it already. Alright?

[Kramer enters, exhausted, frazzled]

KRAMER: Wow man, what a day. Could I use a drink.

[He starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY: Tough day at the office?

KRAMER: Just coming in and that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY: Well, we better get going if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER: Yeah well, count me out. I'm swimming. Old man Leland is busting my hump over these reports. If I don't get them done by nine, I'm toast.

[He takes a swig and reacts]
 

[Inside a night club]

GEORGE: This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female models come up to them]

MODELONE: Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA: These are my friends. Annabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE: Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA: So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODELTWO: A bore.

GEORGE: You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead fiancee, Susan...

[He opens his wallet]

GEORGE: In fact I think I, I may have a picture of her.

[He shows them the picture]

MODELTHREE: Wow, she was beautiful. Do you wanna dance?

 
[Exterior shot of a restaurant]

[Close-up of Gillian's man-hands tearing the restaurant bread in half]

GILLIAN: Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY: No. No thanks, I'm just not hungry.

GILLIAN: Well, then at least drink your beer.

[She's opens the beer with her hands]

JERRY: Oh. Twist off.

GILLIAN: You have a little something on your face.

[She reaches for his face]

JERRY: I can get it.

GILLIAN: Uh, no no, No no. You're missing it, it's higher.

[She reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a man-hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy]

GILLIAN: It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Close-up of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him]

JERRY: I don't want to.

GILLIAN: Make a wish.

JERRY: Okay.

[He closes his eyes and blows on her finger. He opens his eyes and says to himself] 
JERRY: Didn't come true.

GILLIAN: Don't you just love lobster?

[Close-up of her man-hands tearing open a lobster]


[Elaine and Kevin are walking into Reggie's diner]

KEVIN: That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE: I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and Kevin sees them, motioning Elaine to come along]

KEVIN: Yeah! Hey, hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple of my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we just call "Feldman!"

[Gene is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy-looking. Elaine sits with them]

ELAINE: Bizarro world.

 
[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY: Then it does exist.

GEORGE: Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY: So when are you going out with this girl again?

GEORGE: I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY: So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE: Flame on!

 
[At Reggie's. Feldman, Gene, and Kevin are at a booth when Elaine comes and sits with them]

GENE: I got it.

[Kevin grabs the check]

KEVIN: No. You got it last time.

[Gene takes it]

GENE: Don't worry about it.

ELAINE: This is unbelievable.

FELDMAN: Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE: Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN: Nah, it's not, it's just not practical.

KEVIN: Well. See you later, Elaine. Feldman and I gotta get down to the library.

[The three guys are leaving]

ELAINE: What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN: Read!

ELAINE: Hello?

 
[At Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are eating breakfast. Kramer's tired and preoccupied with the paper. Jerry's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice]

JERRY: So uh, Gillian's coming over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

JERRY: Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator and sell tickets.

KRAMER: That's nice.

JERRY: Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER: Well, we're talking now aren't we?

JERRY: I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning...

KRAMER: Oh, here we go.

JERRY: And then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted, we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER: What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time of year?!

JERRY: It's your third day.

KRAMER: I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later.

[He leaves]

JERRY: Well.

[He calls down the hall]

JERRY: Call if you're gonna be late!

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: What? What is going on with you two?

JERRY: Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

ELAINE: Alright, listen. Have you seen my address...

[She sees her address book on the counter]

ELAINE: Ah! There it is. Okay, I got it. I'll see you later.

JERRY: Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you going? I, I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE: Well I, I guess I been at Reggie's.

JERRY: The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE: Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read.

JERRY: I read.

ELAINE: Books, Jerry.

JERRY: Oh. Big deal.

ELAINE: Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the excruciating minutia of every single daily event.

JERRY: Like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, and the teller gives me this look like...

ELAINE: I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY: The whole system is breaking down!


[George is in his bathroom drying his hair and looking at Gillian's picture. In the background on a door is a poster of a close-up of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and George puts the picture and blow drier together on the side of the sink with the dryer's still running]

GEORGE: Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinking, we might just be better of being friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye.

[He hangs up happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo]

GEORGE: No! No!


[At Jerry's apartment]

GILLIAN: Friends. Just friends.

JERRY: Yeah.

GILLIAN: Yeah. Alright. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY: I wish I could, but we're friends.

GILLIAN: I'm just gonna go wash my hands.

JERRY: Good idea.

[The phone rings]

JERRY: There's a beach towel on the rack.

[He answers the phone]

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Jerry! Jerry, my, my hair dryer ruined the picture! And I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY: Who is this?

GEORGE: Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man hands. I'm begging you!

JERRY: If I get it for you will you take me to that club and show me a good time?

GEORGE: Yes! Yes, alright, anything!

[Jerry looks toward the bathroom. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture]

JERRY: Got it.

[But now a man-hand grabs his arm]

JERRY: Oh!

 
[At Jerry's apartment in the dark. Jerry is sitting at the table waiting up as Kramer comes in and turns on the light]

KRAMER: Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY: I'm right here.

[He has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

JERRY: You're late.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY: Like you care.

KRAMER: The work piled up, I lost track of time.

JERRY: Oh! Sure! Sure! You and your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, and I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way...

[He drops the chicken into the sink]

JERRY: ...was for two.

KRAMER: You cooked?

JERRY: I ordered in. It's still effort.

[Kramer winces in pain]

KRAMER: Ow! Jeez!

JERRY: What's wrong?

KRAMER: Ow! It's my stomach.

JERRY: You're probably getting an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing us.

KRAMER: You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. What do you say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY: The coffee shop?

KRAMER: You got it, buddy.

JERRY: I'll call George!

 
[George, Jerry, and Kramer are walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is Elaine coming out of a shop by a liquor store]

JERRY: Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE: Maybe she can get me another picture of man hands. Elaine!

JERRY: Elaine!

KRAMER: Elaine!

[Elaine finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction three other guys are coming: Gene, Kevin, and Feldman]

KEVIN: Hey! Elaine! Hi! Over here!

[Eerie music as Elaine looks one way then the other. All the men continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of Elaine are Kevin, Gene, and Feldman. To the right of her are Kramer, George, and Jerry. It's like a bizarre mirroring]

ELAINE: Jerry, George, Kramer. This is Kevin, Gene, and Feldman.

[The men murmur "How you doing.", "Good to meet you."]

JERRY: This is really weird.

[Kramer's drinks from a bottle of Pepto Bismol]

ELAINE: Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment?

KEVIN: Sure.

[He strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE: Thanks. What, what do you guys want?

GEORGE: Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY: I tried to get him one but man hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, Elaine looks over to see where Kevin is. They are giving a beggar money]

KEVIN: Here you are.

ELAINE: Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.

[George tentatively follows her a couple steps]

GEORGE: Elaine? Can I come?

ELAINE: I'm, I'm sorry. We've already got a George.

[Kevin, Gene, and Feldman cheerfully turn to Elaine as she joins them. They all go on as Jerry, George, and Kramer look on awkwardly]

 
[Interior of Brand-Leland. Kramer's in Leland's office]

KRAMER: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND: Kramer, I've been reviewing your work. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER: Well, I ah, been having trouble at home and uh, I mean ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes.

LELAND: No no, I don't think that's going to do it. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, just trying to get ahead.

LELAND: Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER: I don't even really work here!

LELAND: That's what makes this so difficult.

 
[George is at the Forbidden City]

GEORGE: Hi. George.

MODELFOUR: Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I used to come here all the time with my fiancee back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture.

[He hands her a magazine page]

MODELFOUR: What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE: Huh?

MODELFOUR: That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did.

GEORGE: Ha! Heh.

[A Muscled Bouncer comes up]

BOUNCER: Let's go. Private party.

[He escorts him out]

 
[At Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. Kevin gets up to get it. Gene is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's. What's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones]

KEVIN: Who is it?

ELAINE: It's Lainey!

KEVIN: Hi Elaine!

[He warmly hugs her]

ELAINE: Hi. Oh! Oh oh oh oh!

KEVIN: Come on in!

ELAINE: Okay. Hi Gene!

[She tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor]

ELAINE: Uh ha!

[She smiles and picks up her bag and puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As Kevin gets back to reading, Elaine looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes]

ELAINE: What's up?

KEVIN: Just reading.

[Elaine decides to make herself at home. She opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar with her fingers. In the living room area, Kevin is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker]

KEVIN: Hey. What're you doing?

ELAINE: Eating olives.

KEVIN: Have you ever heard of asking?

[The door bell rings]

KEVIN: Who is it?

FELDMAN: Feldman. From across the hall.

KEVIN: Hold on.

[He unlocks and opens the door]

KEVIN: Hey.

FELDMAN: Hey, Kevin!

KEVIN: Hi.

FELDMAN: Look who I ran into.

[Vargas, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall]

VARGAS: Hello, Kevin.

KEVIN: Hello, Vargas.

[They both break into grins, chuckling, it was a joke]

KEVIN: You want to catch a ballgame this weekend?

VARGAS: Great! I'll see you later!

[He leaves]

KEVIN: Okay. Vargas. So?

FELDMAN: I got them.

KEVIN: Alright! Hey Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE: Oh!

KEVIN: Fourth row, center.

ELAINE: Get out!

[She pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor]

[Gene and Feldman rush to Kevin, who's hurt]

GENE: What is the matter with you?

ELAINE: Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE: Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chains in place. She tries to undo the locks]

ELAINE: It's locked.


[At a meat packing plant. George and Jerry are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. George is dismayed and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction]

JERRY: So this is it, huh?

GEORGE: But it, it was here, I'm telling you it was really here! The, there was a bar and a dance floor.

JERRY: I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? Let's get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo George had brought there the previous night]


[At Kevin's apartment building. The familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny "Brady Bunch" sound effects]

GENE: At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN: Oh, so what did you do?

GENE: I called the phone company and immediately reported the error.

KEVIN: Nice.

[The doorbell rings]

KEVIN: Who is it?

FELDMAN: Feldman. From across the hall.

KEVIN: Hold on.

[Gene's arranging fruit as Kevin goes to unlock and open the door. Feldman's carrying two paper bags of groceries]

FELDMAN: Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN: Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN: Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN: You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug]

KEVIN: Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
