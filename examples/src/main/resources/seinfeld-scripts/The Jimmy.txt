[At The New York Health Club. Jerry, Kramer, and George are getting dressed]

GEORGE:  That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height. What was his name again?

JERRY: Jimmy.

GEORGE: Jimmy, right.

JERRY: I don't know how you could forget. He kept referring to himself in the third person. Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot.

GEORGE: Ah! You're mad just because we beat you.

KRAMER: Jerry it's my fault, I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me, they fester Jerry. Oh, this is gonna plague me.

[He puts on aftershave and cries out]

KRAMER: Oh mama!

[Jimmy walks in]

GEORGE: Hey! Jimmy! Great game.

JIMMY: Oh yeah, Jimmy played pretty good.

GEORGE: Hey you know, I felt we had like a synergy out there, you know. Like we were really helping each other.

KRAMER: What do you got there?

[He looks at Jimmy's peculiar looking tennis shoes]

JIMMY: These?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JIMMY: These are Jimmy's training shoes.

GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these, they sort of, they make your legs stronger.

JIMMY: Oh yeah! Jimmy couldn't jump at all before he got these. Jimmy... was like you.

KRAMER: They're Polymeric.

GEORGE: Polymeric?

KRAMER: Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow.... or die.

GEORGE: Where did you get them?

JIMMY: Jimmy sells them.

GEORGE: You sell them?

JIMMY: Oh yeah! But Jimmy's all out right now. Moving to Manhattan set Jimmy back a bit.

GEORGE: Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in.

JIMMY: Alright.

GEORGE: Alright Jimmy, good talking to you.

JIMMY: Jimmy will see you around.

[Jimmy leaves]

GEORGE: What day is today? Aw, Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr. Wilhelm has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing.

JERRY: Why. You took a shower?

GEORGE: Ah, it wouldn't take. Ten minutes from now I'll be sweating all over again, I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!

KRAMER: You should take cold showers.

GEORGE: Cold showers? They're for psychotics.

KRAMER: Well I take them. They give me a whoosh.

GEORGE: Alright, I'll see you guys later.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: So, you're heading home?

JERRY: No, got a dental appointment.

KRAMER: Ah! What, Tim Whatley?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Oh yeah! I got a check up on Thursday.

JERRY: Oh! How do you like that?

KRAMER: You know you really shouldn't brush twenty-four hours before seeing the dentist.

JERRY: I think that's, eat twenty-four hours before surgery.

KRAMER: Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength.

[Kramer leaves. Jerry is speechless]


[At a meeting at Yankee Stadium]

WILHELM: I called this meeting because we have a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, you know; bases, batting helmets, donuts. But two nights ago they pulled the big one. 

[The camera goes back and forth from Wilhelm to George who keeps pulling on his collar, he's sweating]

WILHELM: They took a pitching machine, a batting cage, the in field tarp and all of Mr. Steinbrenner's vitamins. Now, we have reasons to believe it's an inside job.

GEORGE: Whoa!

WILHELM: If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that you come forward.

[Wilhelm looks at George who's sweating so much it seems he's hiding something]


[In Tim Whatley's dental office]

WHATLEYSRECEPTIONIST: Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.

JERRY: Alright.

[Jerry sits down and browses through the magazine on the table and discovers Tim has Penthouse magazines for patients to read]



[At Jerry's apartment. Elaine is on the phone]

ELAINE: Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr. Pitt.... okay... goodbye. Hey! You want to go see The Velvet Fog?

JERRY: The Velvet fog?

ELAINE: Yeah! Mel Torme, that's his nickname.

JERRY: What the hell is a velvet fog?

ELAINE: Do you wanna go or not?

JERRY: Well, where is it?

ELAINE: He's performing at this A M C A benefit.

JERRY: A M C A?

ELAINE: Able Mentally Challenged Adults

JERRY: Nah. I can't watch a man sing a song.

ELAINE: What are you crazy?

JERRY: They get all emotional, they sway. It's embarrassing.

ELAINE: Well, what am I gonna do for a date? Oh! Do you know that blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?

JERRY: I don't think so.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those...

JERRY: Elaine, I really don't pay much attention to men's faces.

ELAINE: You can't find beauty in a man?

JERRY: No, I find them repugnant and unappealing.

[Kramer bursts in]

KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: To wit

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: No, Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive.

KRAMER:  Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man, George Will.

JERRY: Really!

KRAMER: Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...

ELAINE: He's smart.

KRAMER: No no, I don't find him all that bright.

KRAMER: So you got any cavities?

JERRY: Just one. Gotta go back. Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room. He's got a Penthouse right out on the table.

ELAINE: Penthouse?

JERRY: Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean, I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment.

KRAMER: So what's wrong with that?

JERRY: He's a doctor! I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment.

KRAMER: So, did you take a look?

JERRY: Of course, but that's got nothing to do with it.

KRAMER: Well I'll tell you, I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early.

[George comes in. Kramer walks out]

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Hey! Hey listen, do one of you guys know that, that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?

GEORGE: I, I wouldn't know

ELAINE: You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual.

GEORGE: It doesn't help.

ELAINE: Alright, I'm gone.

GEORGE: I'll see you.

GEORGE: You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together.

JERRY: What are you doing that for? You got a job.

GEORGE: There's a lot of money in this. He's got a proven sales method.

JERRY:  Yeah, what's that?

GEORGE: He jumps!

JERRY: Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmy and George are gonna get rich.

GEORGE: Will you stop with the Jimmies

[Kramer takes something out of the fridge]

KRAMER: Hey! What's this?

JERRY: Kom Pau.

[Kramer tastes the chicken but realizes too late how hot and spicy it is. He gasps and spits it out]

KRAMER: Kom Pau!


[Elaine is at the health club trying to attract the handsome blond guy's attention]

ELAINE: Look at me. Look at Me! Come on, I'm stretching right in front of you. Hey a smile. Ah! We made contact. Alright, one more stretch and then I'll go talk to him.

[Hank leaves as she's ready to make her move. Elaine turns to try to find out where he could be and stops when she takes notice of Jimmy]

JIMMY: You know. Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.

ELAINE: Ah! He is?!

JIMMY: Oh yeah! Jimmy's been watching you, you're just Jimmy's type.

ELAINE: Ah! Really?

JIMMY: Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy doesn't really know anyone.

ELAINE: Oh! Well I'd like, like to get to know him.

JIMMY: Jimmy would like to get to know you.

ELAINE: Ha.


[At Tim Whatley's office. Kramer is in the chair]

TIMWHATLEY: Hey! Kramer.

KRAMER: Boy, you're looking sharp there Tim.

TIMWHATLEY: Yeah well I do what I can. How've you been?

KRAMER: Uh fine, good, yeah. Just been occupying myself with some of your.... reading material.

TIMWHATLEY: So what'll it be, Novocain?

KRAMER: Oh yes, yes indeed.

TIMWHATLEY: Why don't we just clear a path first.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

TIMWHATLEY: You remember Mr. Thirsty.

KRAMER: Alright uh.....

[Whatley puts the suction device in Kramer's mouth and loud suction sounds are heard]


[At the health club where Kramer is trying the vertical lift shoes]

JERRY: Ah! You too with these?

[Kramer is still under the effects of the Novocain and slurs his words heavily]

KRAMER: Yeah I'm on board.

JERRY: So what did Tim say?

KRAMER: Well um, he said I gotta cut out the Skittles.

JERRY: Looks like he gave you some Novocain.

KRAMER: Oh, I'm loaded.

JERRY: So what about the Penthouse? Did you ask him?

KRAMER: Well he said that um, you know, that it helps his patients relax a little bit and he's got a new policy. Adults only.

JERRY: Adults only?

KRAMER: Yeah!!!

JERRY: What the hell's going on over there?

KRAMER: Well you know its great. You know, no kids allowed. You don't have to watch your language.

JERRY: You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist?

KRAMER: He he, when they pull that needle out I let the explicatives fly.

[Kramer reaches for a glass of water and drinks some but manages to spill some out on to the floor]

JERRY: Hey! Hey! Watch it! You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocain did that guy give you?

KRAMER: Well, I can't hold the water.

[Jimmy comes in dribbling]

JIMMY: Oh yeah!! Jimmy's ready.

KRAMER: Hey Jimmy.

GEORGE: Ha ha.

JIMMY: Jimmy's got some new moves.

KRAMER: Go Jimmy.

JIMMY: Check Jimmy out.

[Jimmy slips on Kramer's puddle and falls on his back]

JIMMY: Oh! Jimmy's down!


[The paramedics arrive and take Jimmy out on a stretcher]

JIMMYSPARAMEDIC: It's pretty bad man, I think your buddy's gonna be in traction.

JIMMY: Jimmy might have a compound fracture! Jimmy's going into shock!!

GEORGE: Why weren't you more careful with your drool?!

KRAMER: Hey, I'm doing the best I can!

JERRY: Why are you taking this so personally?

GEORGE: Because if he can't jump, there goes my sneaker business!

KRAMER: Well I said I'm sorry!

JIMMY: Jimmy won't forget you Kramer! Jimmy holds grudges! Let Jimmy Go!

KRAMER: But I can't feel anything!



[Kramer is seen walking down the street with his vertical lift shoes. He's trying to hail a cab]

KRAMER: Hey taxi! Taxi!!

[An elderly gentleman is after the same taxi]

KRAMER: Go ahead, go ahead you got it. He's got it.

[The man is looking him up and down and notices the shoes and the slurred speech]

DEENSFREI: Oh! Please, go ahead take it

KRAMER: No no, you were here first.

DEENSFREI: No. No I, I insist. I'll grab the next one.

KRAMER: Lets share. We share. Alright?

DEENSFREI: Yes! Splendid. That's a great idea.

[Kramer bumps his head as he gets into the cab]

DEENSFREI: My name is Arnold Deensfrei. What is your name?

KRAMER: Uh, Kramer. Nice to meet you.

DEENSFREI: Very nice to meet you Cosmo. Are you heading home?

KRAMER: Yeah! Heading home.

DEENSFREI: Good for you. You are really independent.

KRAMER: Yeah, you're not doing too bad yourself.


[At a sporting goods store. George tries to make a sale. He is putting on the shoes]

GEORGE: Anyway, Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training, yeah!

[George tries three times to jump but barely lifts a couple of inches off the ground. The store personnel get uninterested quickly and leave]


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: The Velvet Fog!!

JERRY: What about the Velvet Fog?

ELAINE: What about the Velvet Fog?

KRAMER: Well, he's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table.

ELAINE: I'm going to that!

KRAMER: I'm a guest of honor.

ELAINE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this, um, Deensfrei.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, Arnold Deensfrei, he runs the A M C A. 

KRAMER: Yeah! Well, that's the guy. He's organizing the dinner.

ELAINE: I know that but why are you going?

KRAMER: Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do.

ELAINE: What you do? You don't do anything.

KRAMER: Well apparently I do something because I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torme.

[Kramer sits on the couch and puts his feet up on the coffee table]

[Elaine points at his shoes]

ELAINE: What are those?

KRAMER: These are my vertical leap training shoes.

JERRY: Wait a second, where you wearing those shoes in the cab?

KRAMER: Yeah! Yeah! Right after I left the Y.

JERRY: Don't you see what's happened? He couldn't talk, he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling.

KRAMER: What!!!

ELAINE: He thinks you're mentally challenged.

JERRY: Well... you know.

ELAINE: Well, what happens when you show up? He'll see that you're not.

JERRY: Not necessarily because...


[At Tim Whatley's dental office. Jerry is sitting in the chair]

TIMWHATLEY: Sheryl, would you ready the nitrous oxide please?

[Whatley inhales the gas mask before handing it over to Jerry]

JERRY: Oh! Where's Jennifer today?

TIMWHATLEY: Oh! She's over at Dr. Cessman's office. We find it fun to swap now and then.



[At Yankee Stadium. George is sitting at his desk eating Kom Pau chicken]

GEORGE: Woo!!

[He taps on his desk loudly]

[The phone rings]

GEORGE: It's George. Oh! Sports wholesaler? Yeah yeah, thanks for calling back. No no no, still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is beautiful athletic gear.

[Wilhelm enters the office as George is talking on the phone. He seems suspicious]

GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry. Call you right back.

WILHELM: So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?

GEORGE: No! Not... nothing.

WILHELM: George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar.

GEORGE: Well, there's no room for someone like that in this organization.

WILHELM: Are you feeling alright George?

GEORGE: Hmm! Fine!

WILHELM: You look a little warm.

GEORGE: It's the chicken.

WILHELM: You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck! You're sweating bullets.

GEORGE: It's the Kom Pau. George likes his chicken spicy.


[At Tim Whatley's office. Jerry wakes up and his vision is blurred. He sees Whatley and Sheryl getting dressed]


[At Monk's Cafe. Jerry and Elaine are talking]

ELAINE: Maybe you were still under the gas. Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas.

JERRY: I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that, my shirt was out!!!

ELAINE: Your shirt was out?

JERRY: I think so.

ELAINE: Well, what kind of shirt was it?

JERRY: You know! Like a tennis shirt.

ELAINE: Oh! Well, you don't tuck those in?

JERRY: Sometimes I tuck them, sometimes I don't.

ELAINE: Well. Were you tucked?

JERRY: I think I was tucked!

ELAINE: Alright, then say you were. I mean, what do you think could have happened?

JERRY: I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow.

ELAINE: Ugh.

JERRY: Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?

ELAINE: What are you getting?

JERRY: I don't think I'm hungry.

ELAINE: Okay. So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single.

JERRY:  But I'm damaged goods now.

ELAINE: Join the club.

JERRY: Hey by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club?

ELAINE: Oh yeah! Jimmy.

JERRY: Jimmy?

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: That's the guy?

ELAINE: Yeah!

JERRY: Can't believe your going out with him.

ELAINE: Why?

JERRY: I don't know. He's so strange.

ELAINE: How so?

JERRY: Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later.

ELAINE: No no, that's not him. That's the guy who gave me Jimmy's number.

JERRY: That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks.

ELAINE: I'm going to go see Mel Torme with him?

JERRY: Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.

[George comes in and sits down with them]

GEORGE: I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr. Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsible for stealing all the merchandise.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Because when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.

JERRY: I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,

GEORGE: George likes spicy chicken.

JERRY: What's that?

GEORGE: I like spicy chicken.

JERRY: No no, you said George likes spicy chicken.

GEORGE: No I didn't.

ELAINE: Yes you did. You said George likes spicy chicken.

JERRY: You're turning into Jimmy.

GEORGE: George is getting upset.


[At the health club. Elaine meets Jimmy who is using crutches]

JIMMY: So what do you want to see Jimmy about?

ELAINE: Well...

[She points at him to be sure it's him]

ELAINE: Jimmy?

JIMMY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: About tonight um, there's been a little misunderstanding.

JIMMY: Ah! Jimmy doesn't like misunderstanding.

ELAINE: Yeah. What happened was....

JIMMY: Jimmy and misunderstandings kind of clash.

ELAINE: You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual.

JIMMY: Well, Jimmy's very unusual.

ELAINE: Well anyway um, see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy...

JIMMY: Hey look. Hank's got a new boyfriend. Jimmy's not threatened by Hanks sexuality. Jimmy's happy for Hank.

ELAINE: Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again.


[At the Marriot for the benefit]

KRAMER: I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?

ELAINE: Yeah!

KRAMER: What kind?

ELAINE: I don't care.

[Kramer leaves]

[Jimmy hobbles in on his crutches]

ELAINE: Hey Jimmy!!

JIMMY: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Elaine got a new dress.

JIMMY: Jimmy likes it.

[Kramer returns]

KRAMER: There's no candy around here.

[He suddenly notices Jimmy]

KRAMER: Hey Jimmy!

JIMMY: Well look who's here.

KRAMER: Whoa!

JIMMY: That's the guy who sidelined Jimmy.

KRAMER: What?

JIMMY: That's the guy who took the bread out of Jimmy's mouth.

[He backs Kramer into a corner]

JIMMY: Jimmy's out of work because of you!

[Jimmy punches Kramer in the mouth and they tumble to the ground]

JIMMY: Jimmy wants a piece of Kramer!

[Fighting ensues and Jimmy gets taken out by hotel security] 

JIMMY: Jimmy's gonna get you Kramer! Hands off Jimmy! Hands off Jimmy! Don't Touch Jimmy! Let go of Jimmy!

[Elaine runs over to Kramer]

[Kramer's voice starts slurring again]

KRAMER: Yeah! My lip swollen?


[Kramer is sitting at the head table. His speech is slurred again]

KRAMER: No no, I've been living alone a long time now.

MELTORME: Well I think that's the tops.


[At Yankee Stadium, in George Steinbrenner's office]

GEORGE: You um, wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Yes George, come in, come in. You know George I've been your biggest supporter around here and that's why I was so disappointed to hear that you been pilfering the equipment.

GEORGE: George would never do anything like that.

MRSTEINBRENNER: No why would I? I own it.

GEORGE: Right!

MRSTEINBRENNER: So what are you saying?

GEORGE: Why would George steal from the Yankees?

MRSTEINBRENNER: He wouldn't.

GEORGE: Of course not

MRSTEINBRENNER: Exactly. I don't what the hell's going on here.

GEORGE: Sir?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Nothing.

GEORGE: Well, seems it's about time for George's lunch.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Yes it is.

[He opens a brown bag on his desk]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Alright, lets see what I have today. Oh, darn it! It's ham and cheese again and she forgot the fancy mustard. I told her I like that fancy mustard. You know could put that fancy mustard on a shoe and it would taste pretty good to me. Oh! She made it up with a cupcake though.

[George is backing out of the office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Hey look at this, you know I got a new system for eating these things, George. I used to peel off the chocolate now I turn it upside down. I eat the cake first and save the frosting for the end.

[George has left the office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: It's almost like its own dessert.


[At the AMCA benefit]

MELTORME: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to dedicate this song to a very courageous young man.

[He looks at Kramer and starts singing]

MELTORME: When you're smiling.

[Kramer looks at the man next to him and smiles]

MELTORME: When you're smiling.

[Kramer makes some unusual contortions with his mouth]

MELTORME: The whole world smiles with you. When you're laughing.

[Mel smiles and points to his smile]

MELTORME: When you're laughing, the sun comes shining through.

[Kramer has a goofy smile on his face]

MELTORME: But when you're crying.

[Mel puts his arm around Kramer]

MELTORME: You bring on the rain. So stop that sign, be happy again.

[Kramer smiles broadly]

MELTORME: Keep on smiling.

[Kramer leans over and smiles at the man beside him]

MELTORME: Because when you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you. The whole world smiles with you.

[Kramer joins in]

KRAMER: You.
