JERRY: Here's what happened last week in case you missed it.

[In Jerry's car]

JERRY: So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.

HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.

JERRY: We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.

[In George's car]

GEORGE: I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.

SUSAN: You, you're passing?

GEORGE: Well, it's... much too low.

[Jerry and George are on the street]

JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.

[He throws his watch in a garbage can]

GEORGE: Is that the one your parents gave you?

JERRY: Yeah, but it never works.

[In Jerry's car]

HELEN: Where's that watch we bought you?

JERRY: It's at the jeweler.

[At the NBC office]

DAVOLA: I would like somebody to hit me.

[In Jerry's apartment]

HELEN: So what's the matter with this Davola guy?

KRAMER: He's after Jerry now.

[In a doctor's office]

MORTY: You know, I never had a back problem until the night I slept on that convertible sofa.

[In George's car]

[Susan gives George some cigars]

SUSAN: Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.

[In Jerry's apartment]

[George hands Kramer the cigars]

GEORGE: Here you go.

KRAMER: Cubans?

GEORGE: Yeah, Cuban cigars.

[Kramer's hair is on fire. He runs to the bathroom to extinguish it]

[In a doctor's office]

[A nurse tears open the Velcro on a blood pressure cuff]

MORTY: Ah!

NURSE: What's wrong?

MORTY: The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. That tearing sound.

[In Jerry's apartment]

Now listen to me, I'm negotiating. Negotiation. This is what you do in business.

[In a doctor's office]

MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?

NURSE: Leave it.

[In Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?

ELAINE: He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.

GEORGE: Tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of this thing.

[In Dr. Reston's office]

ELAINE: His name is... Kramer.

DRRESTON: I want you to tell this young man to give me a call.

[In a doctor's office]

[Morty opens a door and starts shouting into the hallway]

MORTY: My wallets gone! My wallets gone!

[In a restaurant]

HELEN: Where did you get that watch?

UNCLELEO: I found it in a garbage can. What kind of an idiot throws away a perfectly good watch!?


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie, and stress organizer, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?


[At a restaurant]

[Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld, and Uncle Leo are having dinner]

MORTY: I don't understand this jeweler, Jimmy Sherman. He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.

JERRY: Oh, you know these jewelers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries wrapped in a riddle.

[Morty sits brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table. Helen watches her]

HELEN: She's very attractive.

JERRY: She's okay.

HELEN: Just okay?

JERRY: She's nice.

HELEN: She's better than nice.

JERRY: She's alright.

HELEN: She's beautiful.

JERRY: She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I think she's beautiful.

JERRY: So you ask her out.

HELEN: I'm not gonna ask her out.

JERRY: Why not?

HELEN: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.

JERRY: She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.

JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.

UNCLELEO: She's alright.

MORTY: Two exact same watches. He tells you a week and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.


[In George's car]

GEORGE: He said what?

SUSAN: "The hell with them."

GEORGE: "The hell with them?"

SUSAN: Those were his exact words.

GEORGE: Oh boy.

SUSAN: He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys who have no idea and no experience more money?"

GEORGE: He was pretty emphatic?

SUSAN: Pounded on his desk.

GEORGE: Pounded?

[She tosses her purse on the dash]

SUSAN: I told you to take the offer.

GEORGE: Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.

SUSAN: You said it was insulting.

GEORGE: I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.

SUSAN: Well, there's nothing I can do.

GEORGE: Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?

SUSAN: Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.

GEORGE: Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?

SUSAN: You'll have to wait till Monday.

GEORGE: Monday? No no, I can't wait till Monday, that's impossible. I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?

[Susan laughs]

SUSAN: I can't give you his address.

[George looks frustrated for a second then notices Susan's purse on the dash. He grabs it. Susan grabs it and a struggle ensues]

SUSAN: Give it back!

GEORGE: Give me the purse!


[At Kramer's apartment]

[Elaine and Kramer are sitting on the couch]

ELAINE: Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Okay.

KRAMER: Have we been intimate?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

KRAMER: And how often do we do it?

ELAINE: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?

KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. We do it, uh... five times a week, okay?

KRAMER: Oh, baby.

[He smiles]

ELAINE: Oh my God. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?

KRAMER: I know what I'm gonna say.

ELAINE: No no, but I would like to hear it.

KRAMER: No no, I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. Okay, go ahead, do it.

[Elaine picks up the phone and dials while Kramer prepares himself]

ELAINE: Alright, okay. You talk to him.

KRAMER: Talk to him.

ELAINE: Hey, how's your hair?

KRAMER: Oh well, yeah, it's good.

[She hands Kramer the phone]

ELAINE: You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.

KRAMER: Uh yes. Uh uh, doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.

ELAINE: Okay.

[Kramer holds on. He begins to sing along with the hold music]

KRAMER: Johnny... was a rebel. He rode through the land...

[He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine who gives a "what the hell is he doing?" look]

KRAMER: Yeah uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston? Um well, hello there. Ah yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.

ELAINE: No no, not friends.

KRAMER: Well actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends. Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends.

[Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep going]

KRAMER: And uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine.

[Elaine smiles]

KRAMER: And uh, she's very much in love with me and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.

[Elaine looks extremely pleased. She gives Kramer okay gestures]

ELAINE: That's perfect.

KRAMER: If not, I can assure you, doctor that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.

[Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate he's doing so well]

KRAMER: Yes. Yeah, but the point that I...

[Elaine's smile begins to look a bit stiff]

KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible.

[Elaine's face starts to look a bit sick]

KRAMER: Well, I suppose I could but I'd have to shift a few things around, um... hold on for a second will you? Uh...

[Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad and puts it on his knee. Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried]

KRAMER: Uh, go ahead, yeah. Alright uh... yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. Uh, ha, okay. So long.

[Kramer hangs up the phone]

ELAINE: What happened? What'd he say? What's going on here?

KRAMER: Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.

ELAINE: Get together!!

KRAMER: He wants to talk.

ELAINE: Well, why didn't you say no!!

KRAMER: What? Uh... That's interesting.

[Elaine flops back into the couch, let down again by Kramer]

ELAINE: Ugh!


[At a restaurant]

[Naomi, the hostess, stands by the Seinfeld's table]

NAOMI: Did you enjoy your Poisson?

HELEN: It was... different.

NAOMI: And how was yours?

JERRY: Ah, very good.

NAOMI: You should try our mousse. It'll change your life expectancy.

JERRY: No thanks, just the check.

[Naomi leaves]

HELEN: What's the matter with you?

JERRY: What?

HELEN: Why didn't you flirt with her?

JERRY: Come on.

HELEN: She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?

JERRY: What am I gonna say?

HELEN: You just sat there.

JERRY: Well, you made me uncomfortable.

HELEN: You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?

UNCLELEO: Where's the bathroom?

JERRY: In the back, on your right.

[Leo gets up and leaves. The busboy brings the check to the table. As he puts it down, Morty takes hold of it. Jerry grabs it too. A tug of war develops]

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.

HELEN: Jerry.

JERRY: Will you let me pay just once.

MORTY: You're out of your mind.

JERRY: How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!

MORTY: Don't worry about it.

JERRY: What're you gonna do?

MORTY: What's the difference, we'll figure something out.

HELEN: You're not paying.

[Jerry releases his grip allowing a triumphant Morty to take the check]

JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. Because if this works, the whole monetary system is obsolete, we're back to wampum. I'm going to the bathroom.

[Jerry walks away. Morty reads the check with Helen leaning to read it too]

MORTY: How the hell am I gonna pay for this?


[In the restaurant bathroom]

[Jerry enters to find Leo washing his hands. Leo notices Jerry in the mirror]

UNCLELEO: They give you some portion here, huh?

JERRY: Uh, yeah. Hey Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.

UNCLELEO: Aw no no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in show business. I know you're all very busy.

JERRY: So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?

UNCLELEO: Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.

JERRY: Oh, huh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

UNCLELEO: Well, I haven't seen too many like these.

[Leo begins to head for the door. Jerry walks backwards keeping pace with him]

JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one?

UNCLELEO: Aw sure.

[He laughs]

[Leo opens the door and begins to exit. Jerry grabs him by the arm and pulls him back in]

JERRY: Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.


[At an apartment building lobby]

[A uniformed doorman is on the phone to a tenant while a nervous George stands beside him]

RUSSELSDOORMAN: There's a George Bonanza to see you.

GEORGE: Costanza. Costanza.

RUSSELSDOORMAN: George Costanza.

GEORGE: The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing.

[He snaps his fingers]

GEORGE: Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Seinfeld friend.

[He listens to the phone]

RUSSELSDOORMAN: He says call him Monday.

[A desperate George grabs the phone and the doorman's hand and pulls it down so he can speak into it]

GEORGE: Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: It's about the show. It... no, it was...

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time.

[George listens to the phone]

GEORGE: Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.

[George releases his grip on the phone and indicates the doorman should listen to it. Keeping a wary eye on George, he does]

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Very good, sir.

[A happier George slaps the doorman on the shoulder and heads toward Russell Dalrimple's apartment]


[At a restaurant]

[Morty stands, explaining his predicament to the maitre’d, who speaks with an approximate French accent]

MORTY: You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.

MAITRED: Why don't you just let him pay and then you can pay him back?

MORTY: No no, he won't let me do that.

MAITRED: Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?

MORTY: He could wash them.

MAITRED: Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.

MORTY: Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!

MAITRED: Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?

MORTY: You don't understand my...

MAITRED: Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.


[On a street corner]

[Kramer and Elaine stroll to the entrance of Dr. Reston's building]

ELAINE: Now look, don't take too long.

KRAMER: Look at this building. What is this?

ELAINE: I don't know. It's a building.

KRAMER: The door's on a diagonal.

ELAINE: So what?

KRAMER: It's architecturally incorrect.

ELAINE: Just go.

[Kramer opens the door and begins to enter. Elaine waves him goodbye then wonders why she's doing that and gives up]


[At Russell Dalrimple's apartment]

[Russell has opened the door to an anxious George. In the background is a set dinner table, at which sits Cynthia, Russell's beautiful date. She looks haughty and bored throughout the scene]

GEORGE: Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

RUSSELL: We were about to sit down to dinner.

[George motions he's sorry but makes no effort to leave]

RUSSELL: This is Cynthia.

GEORGE: Oh. Oh hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. 
[He peers at the table]

GEORGE: What're you having, veal?

RUSSELL: No.

GEORGE: Looks like veal.

RUSSELL: It's not veal.

GEORGE: Well, it's a good looking piece of meat.

[He laughs nervously]

GEORGE: Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken.

[He tries hard to elicit a laugh]

RUSSELL: Who gave you my address?

GEORGE: Now that's a fair question. It is, um... Jerry, yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine. He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.

[Russell closes the door]

GEORGE: He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.

[Cynthia rises and slinks past George toward the living room area]

GEORGE: Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously the guy has his problems.

RUSSELL: So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?

[Cynthia sits on the couch and puts her wine glass on the coffee table. As George speaks, Russell crosses to the coffee table, picks up the glass and puts down a coaster before sitting the glass on it]

GEORGE: Well, you know, it's really very funny because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. You know, I, I misinterpreted.

CYNTHIA: Russell, where's the TV Guide?

GEORGE: Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny program...

RUSSELL: Blossom's on Monday.

GEORGE: Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC.

[He forces some laughter]

RUSSELL: Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.

GEORGE: Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?  Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand and I never came up here, we never talked, alright? You take good care.

[He moves past Russell toward the door]

GEORGE: It was nice seeing you again and nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?

[George is opening the door]

RUSSELL: Alright, now look, these deals are already made.

[George closes the door and turns back to Russell]

GEORGE: Alright, let me just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.

[George opens the door and is halfway through]

RUSSELL: Mister Costanza.

[George re-enters again]

GEORGE: Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...

[George is halfway through the door again]

CYNTHIA: Russell, can we eat?

RUSSELL: Alright. Eight thousand.

GEORGE: You've made Jerry very happy.

[George exits and Russell closes the door firmly. As Russell returns to Cynthia there is a tentative tap at the door. Russell opens it to reveal George]

GEORGE: May I just use your bathroom for a moment?


[In the restaurant bathroom]

[Leo and Jerry are mid-negotiation over the watch]

JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!

UNCLELEO: Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.

JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!

UNCLELEO: I've never seen a band like this.

JERRY: Alright. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!

UNCLELEO: You have it on you?

JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.

[Jerry fetches out his wallet]

JERRY: This is unbelievable.

[Jerry begins handing over a wad of bills to Leo. The door to the bathroom opens and Morty enters]

MORTY: What the hell is going on here?


[At Dr. Reston's office]

[Elaine waits on the street outside while Kramer introduces himself to Dr. Reston]

KRAMER: Well, it uh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

[They shake hands]

DRRESTON: Thank you for coming in.

KRAMER: Thank you.

DRRESTON: Please, sit down.

[Dr. Reston sits in one of a pair of leather armchairs which face each other, he crosses his legs]

KRAMER: Okay.

[Kramer sits and the leather of the chair makes a series of embarrassing rumbles and squeaks with more of the same as he emulates Dr Reston's crossed legs sitting position]

DRRESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Um, coffee? Anything?

KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, do you have a uh, decaf cappuccino?

DRRESTON: I don't think we have that.

KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.

DRRESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink.

DRRESTON: This is an office.

KRAMER: That's true. But you know, I can't help but think that uh...

DRRESTON: So tell me Mister Kramer...

KRAMER: ...Okay, yes, shoot.

DRRESTON: Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.

KRAMER: Oh, alrighty uh...

[He moves in his seat resulting in another digestive tract rumble from the leather]

KRAMER: Well, what we have here doctor is um, an extraordinary situation.

DRRESTON: Is it?

KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it.


[On the street corner]

[Elaine is waiting outside for Kramer. Along the street strolls Joe Davola, singing as he goes]

DAVOLA: ...Traveling along...

[Elaine recognizes the tune and joins in]

ELAINE: ...singing a song, side by side...

[Davola stops and looks at Elaine. He looks like he likes what he sees and Elaine seems interested too. They flirt]

ELAINE: Wow. You really have a terrible voice.

DAVOLA: Do I know you?

ELAINE: Uh, I don't think so.

DAVOLA: Because you really look familiar.

ELAINE: Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on um, Mount Rushmore.

DAVOLA: Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.

DAVOLA: Oh really.

ELAINE: Um, trustbuster, bust this.

[They laugh and smile at each other]


[At Dr. Reston's office]

[Kramer and Dr Reston are also laughing]

KRAMER: You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. You are absolutely right.

DRRESTON: I'm glad we agree.

KRAMER: Hey, would you like a cigar? You know, they're Cubans.

DRRESTON: I'd love one.

[Kramer hands over a cigar and fetches a match from his pocket]

KRAMER: Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.

[Kramer strikes a match on the sole of his shoe]

DRRESTON: If you ever feel a need to talk to someone...

[He lights Dr. Reston's cigar]

KRAMER: Uh huh.

DRRESTON: ...about anything you have my number.

[Kramer lights his own cigar]

KRAMER: Well that's very kind of you.

[Kramer puts down the match, not noticing he's placed it on a box of tissues. He and Dr. Reston puff contentedly at their cigars]

KRAMER: Mmm, these are good, huh?

[Kramer notices he's set light to the top tissue in the box]

KRAMER: Oh.

[Kramer pulls the smoldering tissue from the box. He shakes it to put out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for it he keeps the rest of the tissue in his hand where it burns his fingers. He jumps, almost dropping his cigar and sucks at his burned digits]


[On the street corner]

[Elaine is using Davola's back as a rest as she jots her number on a piece of paper]

ELAINE: I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?

DAVOLA: No, I don't think so.

[Elaine hands the piece of paper and the pen back to Davola as they laugh at the ludicrous possibility that he might be a nut]


[At a restaurant]

[Naomi is handing her card to Jerry]

JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.

NAOMI: Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.

JERRY: Oh, really? You don't seem that desperate.

NAOMI: Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?

NAOMI: Why?

JERRY: They eat fish.

[Naomi starts to laugh at his joke. It is of course the laugh later described as "Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer". It's loud and persistent. Jerry leaves, but then leans back around the corner with a look of disbelief on his face]


[In Dr. Reston's office lobby]

[A cheerful Joe Davola waits for the elevator to arrive, whistling "Side By Side". The elevator arrives with a ding of the bell. The door opens and Kramer steps out, shielded from Davola by other passengers. Kramer walks away, relighting his cigar, as Davola enters the elevator, still whistling happily]


[On the street corner]

[Elaine sits on the steps outside the building. The door opens and one of the other elevator passengers exits, he releases the door which swings shut, almost striking Kramer. Kramer walks toward Elaine]

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: What happened? What took you so long?

KRAMER: Hey, he's a terrific guy.

ELAINE: What? What are you talking about? What'd he say?

KRAMER: Well, we talked about a lot of things.

[The camera pans up toward the lighted window of Dr. Reston's office]

ELAINE: You talked about a lot of things? Well...

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Did you talk about us?

[Elaine and Kramer's voices fade out and the voices inside the window fade up]

DAVOLA: I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her name's Elaine. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

DRRESTON: Did you say Elaine?


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? What, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh no, another head case!"


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry brings his parents suitcases from the bedroom. Helen is finishing packing]

MORTY: You should have told me it didn't work.

JERRY: I know, I know.

HELEN: You didn't have to throw it out.

JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.

[The intercom buzzes]

HELEN: Oh, that must be Leo.

JERRY: I would have taken you to the airport.

HELEN: He has nothing to do.

JERRY: Neither do I. Yeah?

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. It's George.

MORTY: Oh, it's George.

HELEN: What ever happened with NBC and the deal?

JERRY: Ah, George turned it down.

HELEN: He turned it down?

JERRY: Yeah.

HELEN: Why did he do that?

JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.

HELEN: What does Ted Danson have to do with it?

MORTY: Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

JERRY: Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Hey.

MORTY: Hey, Georgie boy, how are you?

GEORGE: Hey, Mr. Seinfeld.

[He shakes Morty's hand]

GEORGE: Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. How are you?

[He approaches Helen for a greeting]

HELEN: What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: What'd I do?

JERRY: What about NBC? Did you hear anything?

GEORGE: Yeah, as a matter of fact I did.

[Jerry looks expectantly but George makes him wait]

GEORGE: We got a deal.

[There is an outpouring of jubilation and congratulations aimed at George]

JERRY: Hey that's wonderful, we got a deal!

MORTY: You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George?

[He slaps George on the shoulder]

GEORGE: Uh, please, Morty.

MORTY: No no no, he knows how to talk to these people. No one's gonna take advantage of Georgie.

[He slaps George's shoulder again]

GEORGE: I'm just happy to be working with your talented son.

JERRY: Aw.

GEORGE: Who's not doing this for the money.

JERRY: Come on.

GEORGE: You have no idea how refreshing that is.

JERRY: So what'd we get?

GEORGE: Eight thousand dollars.

JERRY: Beautiful!

GEORGE: That's uh, for the two of us.

HELEN: Four thousand apiece?

JERRY: Let me see if I understand this. In other words, you held out for less money.

GEORGE: I was wrong, you were right.

JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation as I understand it is to get your price to go up.

GEORGE: You're smart, I'm dumb.

JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.

[The intercom buzzes]

HELEN: That's gotta be Leo.

JERRY: Yeah?

UNCLELEO: Leo.

JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.

MORTY: Alright, let's get going.

JERRY: Dad, before we go I got a little something for you.

[Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers it to Morty]

JERRY: A present.

MORTY: A present?

[Morty opens it]

MORTY: Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, you see.

JERRY: Come on, you lost your wallet. I figured I'd get you another one.

HELEN: I hope you didn't spend too much on that.

MORTY: I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.

HELEN: He's something, your son, isn't he?

JERRY: Ah hah, alright, let's go.

[Everyone begins to head for the door]

MORTY: You're a terrific kid.

[Jerry picks up a suitcase]

JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

[George picks up the other suitcase as Morty and Helen exit]

HELEN: How could anybody not like you?

GEORGE: You're very special.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.


[On the street]

[Uncle Leo has the trunk of his car open and looks impatient]

UNCLELEO: Hey, let's go! It's twelve uh...

[He checks his watch]

UNCLELEO: Twelve twenty-two.

MORTY: Alright, Leo.

JERRY: Hey, Uncle Leo.

UNCLELEO: Hi, hi.

JERRY: How you doing?

[There are murmurs of greetings]

JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.

UNCLELEO: Yeah, I hate to give it up.

JERRY: Yeah. Hey dad, you sure you don't need any more money?

MORTY: Jerry!

JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.

[Helen hugs Jerry]

HELEN: Bye bye, Jerry.

GEORGE: Bye Mrs. Seinfeld, take care.

[Morty hugs Jerry]

MORTY: Bye bye. Thanks again for the wallet.

[George shakes hands with Morty]

GEORGE: Morty, always a pleasure.

JERRY: Take care now. So long.

[Jerry and George walk away to cross the street back to the apartment. They speak quietly so Helen and Morty don't overhear]

GEORGE: Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.

JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.

GEORGE: You're kidding.

JERRY: He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.

GEORGE: Man, would I like to see the look on his face.

[Jerry gives a final wave to his parents. They wave back]

MORTY: You believe this?

HELEN: What?

MORTY: It's Velcro.

HELEN: You're kidding.

MORTY: Who needs this?

[He tosses the wallet into the trash bin]

MORTY: Leo, let's go.

[Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and walks toward the driver's door. He stops as something catches his eye. Leo picks the wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching and tucks it into his pocket as he goes to get in the car]


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: Main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no license, no registration.
 [He waves an imaginary wallet]

JERRY: "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes, "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
