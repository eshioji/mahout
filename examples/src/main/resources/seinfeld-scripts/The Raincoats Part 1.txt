[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive through and hand shakes is the worst. There's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release. You let go there're hanging on. I have actually said to people, "Hey the handshake is over!" Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say, "That's three strikes, you're out."


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George and Jerry are at the usual booth]

JERRY: You know their timing couldn't be worse.

GEORGE: Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?

JERRY: You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh, backed up.

GEORGE: When are they leaving for Paris?

JERRY: Not for another three days.

GEORGE: What about her place?

JERRY: She lives with her parents.

GEORGE: Really? Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.

JERRY: Yeah, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.

GEORGE: Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?

JERRY: The baldies

GEORGE: Hey, by the way, my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.

JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip. It's their anniversary present.

[Alec and Joey enter]

ALEC: Hey guys.

GEORGE: Hey Alec.

JERRY: Hey Alec.

ALEC: This is Joey.

GEORGE: Hey Joey, how you doing?

ALEC: Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kind of running the local chapter. What do you say George?

GEORGE: Well uh...

JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?

GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.

ALEC: That's great George, thanks a lot. I'll get in touch with you.

JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother...

ALEC: Yeah, alright Joey that's enough, let's go. See you.

JERRY: What happened?

GEORGE: What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?

JERRY: Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?


[On the street]

[Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk]

JERRY: Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?

GEORGE: Yeah, it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.

JERRY: Yeah, it's much better isn't it?

GEORGE: Oh, no comparison.

JERRY: Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French English dictionaries.

GEORGE: Hey hey hey hey hey hey.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right?

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.

JERRY: What about little Joey?

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: Ah, I think he's probably better off.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Morty and Helen are sitting at Jerry's Table. Jerry and George are standing by them]

GEORGE: I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris...

[He hands Morty the postcards]

GEORGE: ...all you have to do is drop them in any mailbox.

MORTY: But there are no stamps on these.

GEORGE: Well no not yet, you gotta buy French stamps. I, I'll reimburse you of course.

HELEN: Why are you doing this?

JERRY: He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.

HELEN: Why?

JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Oh hey, Helen uh, could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?

HELEN: I told you it was good.

[She hands Kramer the lotion]

[Kramer puts on the lotion]

KRAMER: Yeah.

HELEN: It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.

KRAMER: Mmm.

[He smells the lotion as he rubs it in]

KRAMER: I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.

JERRY: Yeah, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.

KRAMER: Yeah.

MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.

KRAMER: Well uh, that doesn't surprise me. Yeah, I bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.

GEORGE: Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, you think they're worth something?

KRAMER: Yeah, if they're vintage and you're a widow.

GEORGE: What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?

KRAMER: Well I suppose the children do.

GEORGE: Yes, I suppose they do.

KRAMER: Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.

[Kramer goes to turn the door knob and falls straight to the floor slipping off the knob, then continues to try to open the door with no one really watching. He then uses his coat to get a grip and then smiles and exits]

GEORGE: Hey uh, I just remembered uh, my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?

[Morty and Helen look at each other]

HELEN: Tonight?

GEORGE: Yeah, they're making Paella.

HELEN: Uh, oh, I don't think we think we can make it tonight. We have plans.

JERRY: What plans?

HELEN: We have plans.

JERRY: Where'd you get plans?

HELEN: We have plans.

GEORGE: Well um, what about tomorrow night?

HELEN: Maybe.

GEORGE: Okay uh, I guess I'll tell them that.

MORTY: Hey give them our best though.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: I'll call you later.

GEORGE: Yeah.

[George tries to open the door and his hand slips. He then exits. Jerry makes sure the door is closed]

JERRY: So what plans do you have?

MORTY: None.

JERRY: So how come you're not going over there for dinner?

HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanza's.

MORTY: We can't stand them.

JERRY: Really? Since when?

HELEN: Since always. We've never liked them.

JERRY: Why?

HELEN: Well they're so loud, they're always fighting its uncomfortable, you never notice?

JERRY: No, I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.

MORTY: Well we do.

[The intercom buzzes. Jerry goes over to answer it]

JERRY: Yeah?

[Elaine and Aaron are heard laughing on the Intercom]

ELAINE: It's us.

JERRY: Oh, come on up. It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?

HELEN: We adore Elaine.

JERRY: She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.

HELEN: What's he like?

JERRY: He's nice, bit of a close talker.

HELEN: A what?

JERRY: You'll see. Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanza's.

HELEN: They're exhausting, it's like being in an asylum.

[Elaine and Aaron enter]

JERRY: Hi.

MORTY: Hello Elaine.

[Morty and Helen give Elaine a hug]

ELAINE: This is Aaron.

HELEN: Hello Aaron

MORTY: Hello.

[Aaron gets in Helen's face]

AARON: So how long you folks in town?

HELEN: Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.

AARON: Ah.

MORTY: We're going with a select charter group.

AARON: I love France.

[He moves over to Morty's face]

AARON: I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give them to you.

HELEN: We can't take money.

AARON: Oh no, it's a gift from us.

ELAINE: Oh, that is so nice Aaron. Isn't he nice? So listen has Jerry been showing you a good time?

JERRY: No, I haven't.

AARON: You know I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?

HELEN: Really, you could do that?

AARON: Easily.

HELEN: I wouldn't be any trouble?

AARON: Of course not.

HELEN: When would we go?

AARON: How about right now?

MORTY: I'm ready.

HELEN: Are you sure?

AARON: Yes.

HELEN: Okay, let me get my coat.

[Helen goes to get her coat]

[Aaron walks over to Elaine and gets in her face]

AARON: Elaine what do you say?

ELAINE: Well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.

AARON: Oh.

[He gets in Jerry's face]

AARON: How about you Jerry?

JERRY: I'm swamped.

AARON: You sure? You could examine the art work up close.

JERRY: Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.

ELAINE: Yeah, that'll happen.

AARON: Alright. We're off.

[Aaron, Helen, and Morty head out the door]

MORTY: Okay, bye.

HELEN: Bye.

AARON: Bye.

JERRY: Okay, bye bye. Have a good time.

ELAINE: Bye.

AARON: See everybody later.

[Morty and Helen leave. Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss]

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: What is that?

JERRY: Maybe he was just trying to be nice.

ELAINE: Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?

JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.

[Jerry walks over to the couch sits down and picks up the phone]

ELAINE: What?

[He dials]

JERRY: He got them out of the house.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Call Rachel.

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: Ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel!

[He hangs up the phone very disappointed]

ELAINE: Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.

[Elaine kisses at Jerry. Jerry looks at her in disgust]


[At the Costanza's house]

FRANK: They're not coming?

GEORGE: No, they had plans.

ESTELLE: How could they have plans?

GEORGE: That's what I wanna know.

FRANK: Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're our dear friends.

ESTELLE: What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?

GEORGE: They said tomorrow, maybe.

FRANK: Maybe?

ESTELLE: Maybe they don't like us.

FRANK: Why wouldn't they like us?

[He tastes the Paella, disgusted]

FRANK: Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?

ESTELLE: Ah, keep quiet.

FRANK: What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?

GEORGE: I don't know what the reason could be.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Morty, Helen, and Aaron enter]

JERRY: Oh hi, hi.

AARON: Ah Jerry, you would not believe the time we had.

HELEN: Aaron is quite the tour guide.

MORTY: Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?

JERRY: Oh sure like Monet.

MORTY: Don't you think he had to be uh, near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.

JERRY: Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Day Day.

MORTY: I say the guy was painting without his glasses.

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Hello? Rachel, yeah uh, no they're back.

HELEN: Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.

JERRY: Uh, ha ha, yeah well, uh, I'm sorry too I'll call you later, okay bye. 
[He hangs the phone up]

AARON: Well I should be going.

HELEN: Oh, thanks again.

AARON: Bye.

HELEN: Bye bye.

[Kramer enters]

AARON: Oh you must be Kramer.

[He advances on Kramer and gets in his face. Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground]

AARON: I've heard about you.

KRAMER: You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.

AARON: Well see you later.

KRAMER: Yeah.

AARON: Bye.

JERRY: Bye.

KRAMER: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner?

HELEN: We have no plans.

[Morty notices Kramer's coat]

MORTY: Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.

KRAMER: Now, what is an Executive?

JERRY: The belt less trench coat. My father invented it.

MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.

HELEN: Why would they? Nobody bought them then.

MORTY: He's wearing one.

KRAMER: Yeah, these are a hot item over at Rudy's.

MORTY: You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?

KRAMER: Get them up here. You give me twenty-five percent I'll take care of everything.

MORTY: You gotta deal.

[Kramer and Morty shake hands]

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.

MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.

HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.

MORTY: He'll send them express.

HELEN: You're crazy.

MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.

JERRY: Nah, I'm paying for the trip.

MORTY: So much the better.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George and Alec are sitting at the booth closest to the door]

GEORGE: Anyway, it's kind of a fluke thing but uh, I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.

ALEC: Paris huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, you know I feel terrible about Joey but it's just, it's a great business opportunity. I, I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.

ALEC: Where will you stay?

GEORGE: An apartment complex, the uh, the Eiffel Towers. Um, like I said uh, you'll be getting a postcard uh, in a few days and again I'm sorry.

ALEC: George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.

GEORGE: Fantastic?

ALEC: Yeah, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone. You know he's kind of withdrawn but he seems to take to you.

[George smiles in surprise]

ALEC: So it's a perfect solution.

GEORGE: Gee what a coincidence.

ALEC: And you'll send me a postcard.


[At Elaine's apartment]

[Elaine and Aaron lying in bed]

AARON: Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

AARON: And that Morty, I'll tell you, that guy is full of life. He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him...

ELAINE: Aaron.

AARON: Yes?

ELAINE: Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?

AARON: Well, they were in from out of town. I thought they would enjoy it.

ELAINE: Uh huh, um, you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?

AARON: No, it was fun.

ELAINE: You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?

AARON: Yeah, they bought me a coke.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Morty and Jerry are sitting at his table. Kramer is standing next to Morty. Helen is getting the fold out sofa ready to sleep]

KRAMER: So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt less trench coat?

MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.

[Jerry smiles abd points to himself and nods with cards in his hands]

MORTY: So I took out my belt just to threaten him and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.

KRAMER: How serendipitous.

MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.

KRAMER: Mmm.

JERRY: He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain hat but that never materialized. Alright, come on let's play.

KRAMER: Did you call Jack Klompus yet?

MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey, I'll call him right now.

JERRY: Ah come on.

MORTY: Just a second.

[He goes to grab the phone]

HELEN: Jerry, have you seen Schindler's List?

JERRY: No, I haven't seen it yet.

HELEN: Oh, you have to go, you have to.

JERRY: I'm going.

HELEN: You have to.

JERRY: Okay.

MORTY: Hello Jack?

[Jack in Florida]

JACK: Yeah.

MORTY: It's Morty.

JACK: Who died?

MORTY: Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. In my garage there are a couple of boxes.

JACK: What boxes?

MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes.

JACK: Alright, how the hell do I know?

MORTY: Anyway, there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.

JACK: I thought you're going to Paris.

MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.

JACK: What's in the boxes?

MORTY: Raincoats.

JACK: Raincoats? You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.

HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.

JACK: When do you want these?

MORTY: Send them tomorrow.


[At the Costanza's house]

[George, Estelle, and Frank are sitting at the table for breakfast all still in what they slept in]

ESTELLE: You think they're coming tonight?

GEORGE: I don't know, they said maybe.

FRANK: Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.

ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella.

FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.

GEORGE: Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.

ESTELLE: Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?

GEORGE: I, I wasn't in the attic.

ESTELLE: I heard noise.

GEORGE: Maybe it was a mouse.

[Frank jumps to his feet]

FRANK: Okay, that's it! We're moving!

GEORGE: What?

FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation.

GEORGE: You haven't even seen one.

FRANK: Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.

ESTELLE: Alright Frank, that's enough.

[Frank sits back down]


[At Rudy's Antique Boutique]

[Rudy is checking out the clothes]

GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long because I couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever.

RUDY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?

RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you, there's nothing here too spectacular.

GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.

RUDY: I'll give you uh, two hundred dollars for the three boxes.

GEORGE: Could you make it two twenty-five? That was his high game in bowling.

RUDY: Yeah, I'm in a good mood here.

GEORGE: Thank you.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey, George what are you doing here?

GEORGE: Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things.

[He looking into Kramer's eyes]

GEORGE: That's what he would have wanted.

KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha.

GEORGE: That'll do.

KRAMER: Oh, hey guess what? Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.

GEORGE: Hey that's swell.

KRAMER: Yeah, we worked it out all over dinner last night.

GEORGE: Dinner?

[He grabs Kramer]

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: You had dinner with the Seinfeld's?

KRAMER: Yeah, last night.

GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while?

KRAMER: No, it was a spur of the moment. Well, you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.

GEORGE: They had plans, they had plans!

[He leaves]

KRAMER: Oh, boy I've never seen these before.

[He looks at the clothes George just sold Rudy]

RUDY: Well they just came in, part of my spring time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.

KRAMER: Oh, I'll take these.

RUDY: Alright.

KRAMER: Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?

RUDY: Sure that's the Executive.

KRAMER: Yeah, you have any others?

RUDY: I wish, they don't make them anymore.

KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?

RUDY: Very interested.

KRAMER: Because they're coming in from Florida as we speak.

RUDY: Well bring them in.

KRAMER: So you'll buy them?

RUDY: I don't see what would possibly stop me.

[Out of one of the boxes George sold Rudy flies a couple of moths as the scene ends]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[George enters]

GEORGE: Ah!

[He looks around for Jerry and finds him]

GEORGE: Ah ha! They had plans huh? They were busy! They were busy with their...

[He does a little dance to make the plans seem all that important]

GEORGE: ...big plans!

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: Mom and pop Seinfeld

JERRY: Look, I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.

JERRY: Oh, they were tired it was a last minute thing.

GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?

JERRY: That's right.

GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?

JERRY: Absolutely.

GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.

JERRY: These the people you currently live with?

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?

JERRY: Look, I really don't know what they're plans are.

GEORGE: Okay, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.

JERRY: What is that anyway?

GEORGE: It's a Spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish and meat with rice. Very tasty.

JERRY: I'll tell them.

GEORGE: Hey, could you do one other thing for me?

JERRY: Name it.

GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. Is that a coincidence? Uh, you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going.

JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?

GEORGE: Alright, if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.


[At Elaine's office]

[Elaine is at her desk. Joanna is standing near the door]

JOANNE: So where's he taking you?

ELAINE: Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and then we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.

JOANNE: You are one lucky girl. Wish I could find a nice guy.

[Joanne goes to leave. Aaron enters]

JOANNE: Hi Aaron.

[He gets in Aaron's face]

AARON: Hey Joanne.

[He turns to Elaine and goes over to her]

AARON: Hey.

ELAINE: Hi.

[Elaine and Aaron kiss]

[Helen enters]

HELEN: Hello, Hello.

[Morty enters]

MORTY: Hello Elaine.

[Morty gives Elaine a kiss. Elaine is in shock]

AARON: I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.

ELAINE: Oh, great.

MORTY: This is some office. What's the square footage?

HELEN: You don't mind to you Elaine?

ELAINE: Mind? Oh, of course not.

AARON: We can make a whole day of it.

MORTY: This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?

ELAINE: I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld.

[Collection of Scenes with the music and singing from "My Fair Lady" over them. First the matinee where we see from left to right Helen, Morty, Elaine, and Aaron. Morty opens a candy bar takes a bite, then offers it to Elaine, then Aaron who takes it as the scene changes to the Cafe 123. At the restaurant we see from left to right Morty, Elaine, Helen, and Aaron. Morty is pointing at a painting while talking to Elaine then takes off his glasses. Next George is seen getting ready to hop into a cab when Morty, Elaine, Aaron, and Helen ride by in a horse drawn carriage, Handsome Cab, drinking Champaign. George then smacks the top of the cab in disgust. Song from "My Fair Lady" "I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but all at once my heart would fly"]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and Rachel making out on Jerry's couch]

JERRY: We better not.

[They make out some more, then stop] 
JERRY: They're gonna be here any second.

RACHEL: When are they leaving?
