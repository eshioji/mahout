[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: There's no way that moving in with your parents is a sign that your life is right on track. There's no way that you could fake this even, "Yeah things doing great, I've got a terrific girl, I got a great job making a lot of money and if everything goes according to plan, I'm gonna be moving back in with my parents soon." It's like getting busted on a parole violation and thrown back into the slammer. "In the opinion of the board you need further rehabilitation I'm afraid." And you, you go back into that little room of yours. You feel so huge, it's like you could take your bed and just crush it with your hands. You can hold your parents between your fingers.

[He positions his hand like he is holding two parents between his fingers]

JERRY: And going, "Why was I so afraid of you people when I was growing up?"


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and George are waiting for Kramer so he can help them move George's stuff back into his parent's house]

GEORGE: I can't believe this.

JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.

GEORGE: How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.

JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.

GEORGE: How can you compare you parents to my parents?

JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out, ever!

GEORGE: My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!

JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.

GEORGE: Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee hee, never went, "Ha!"

JERRY: A smirk?

GEORGE: Maybe! And I'm moving back in there!

JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.

GEORGE: No no no no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.

[Kramer stumbles in]

KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. You know, I still don't understand why do you want to move back in with your parents?

GEORGE: I don't want to! I'm out of money! I got seven hundred and fourteen dollars in the bank.

KRAMER: Well, move in here.

JERRY: What's that?

KRAMER: Why doesn't he just move in here?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!

KRAMER: You can move in with me if you want.

GEORGE: Thank you. I uh... that might not work out.


[At the Costanza's house]

[Jerry, George, and Kramer enter carrying George's luggage. Kramer clumsily bangs the wall with one of the suitcases]

ESTELLE: Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!

KRAMER: Hello, Mrs. Costanza.

ESTELLE: Hello, Kramer. Close the door.

[They set down George's luggage]

KRAMER: Well, I gotta bring in more stuff.

[He heads for the door]

ESTELLE: More stuff?!

KRAMER: Yeah.

ESTELLE: How much is there?!

GEORGE: There's more.

ESTELLE: So, how are you Jerry?

JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.

ESTELLE: Nah, not interested.

JERRY: No no, it, it's really funny. There's these two guys...

ESTELLE: Tell it to the audience.

[George gives Jerry an "I told you so" look]

ESTELLE: Here.

[She picks up a plate full of sandwiches]

ESTELLE: I made some bologna sandwiches.

GEORGE: Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!

ESTELLE: What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.

JERRY: No thanks.

[Kramer enters with some more suitcases]

ESTELLE: Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?

KRAMER: Uh... no thanks.

[He goes back out the door]

ESTELLE: I think you're all a little touched in the head. You're so worried about your health. You're young men.

JERRY: I really don't eat it.

ESTELLE: What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?

JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Alright, that's it. Anything else?

GEORGE: No, that's it.

[A horn honks from outside the house]

KRAMER: Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright.

[He leaves]

JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going.

[He heads for the door]

[George runs over to him, not wanting him to leave] 

GEORGE: What? You're going?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What, what are you doing later?

JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going, "Excuse me?", "What was that?"

GEORGE: Yeah, maybe, maybe I'll meet you?

ESTELLE: No George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.

GEORGE: Oh, okay. Talk to you later.

JERRY: Yeah, take it easy.

[He leaves]

[George watches his mother sitting contentedly on the couch. She's staring off into space]

GEORGE: Oh my God.

[He buries his face into his hands]


[At a restaurant]

[Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and Leslie are all laughing]

ELAINE: Okay, well, he had this idea for a pizza place where you make your own pie!

[She laughs]

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: You remember that?

KRAMER: Yeah, that was a good one.

JERRY: Well.

[Kramer's girlfriend starts to mumble out some words, but Kramer's the only one who seems to hear her. Jerry and Elaine both bend forward, trying to hear what she's saying]

ELAINE: What's that?

JERRY: Excuse me?

[She "talks" some more. Jerry and Elaine still can't hear her. They give up, leaning back in their seats]

JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

ELAINE: Yep, yeah.

KRAMER: You know that uh, Leslie is in the clothing business? She's a designer.

ELAINE: Oh?

KRAMER: In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion. It's a, a puffy shirt.

[Leslie mumbles to Kramer]

KRAMER: Well yeah, it, it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.

ELAINE: Oh, a puffy shirt.

JERRY: Puffy.

KRAMER: Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it. To be all puffy and devil may care.

[Leslie starts "talking", Kramer laughs. Jerry and Elaine have no clue what she's saying. They lean closer]

KRAMER: That's true.

[He gets up]

KRAMER: I'll be right back.

[He walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low talker. A moment passes]

ELAINE: Uh, oh, Jerry's going to be on the Today show on Friday.

JERRY: Yeah, that's right!

ELAINE: Yep, yep. Um, he's promoting a, a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they uh, they clothe the poor and the homeless.

JERRY: And the indigent.

ELAINE: And the indigent, yeah. I, I do volunteer work for them. I, I set the whole thing up and I got Jerry to do it.

[Leslie starts talking. Jerry sitting back not hearing what she said, just shacks his head. Elaine who can't hear either is leaned in trying hard to listen]

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yep.

[Leslie talks some more]

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: Yep.

JERRY: Yep.

ELAINE: Mmm


[At another restaurant]

ESTELLE: Maybe you should take a civil service test.

GEORGE: I'm not taking a civil service test.

FRANK: Look at this, George.

[He takes a coin out of his pocket]

FRANK: You ever seen a silver dollar?

GEORGE: Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.

ELAINE: Why don't you want to take a civil service test?

GEORGE: To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?

FRANK: Would you believe when I was eighteen I had a silver dollar collection?

ESTELLE: I don't understand. You get job security, you get a pay check every week.

GEORGE: I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?

FRANK: You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a... phobia.

ESTELLE: So what are you gonna do?!

GEORGE: I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent, something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!

FRANK: I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.

[He does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand]

GEORGE: Oh my God.

FRANK: I don't like this waiter.

[He holds up his hand to get the waiters attention, starts snapping]

FRANK: Look at him. He sees us. He doesn't want to come over.

GEORGE: I need some air.

ESTELLE: George, where are you going?!

GEORGE: I got a lot of thinking to do.

[Scene cuts to the front of the restaurant. George accidentally runs into a woman causing her to drop her purse. Items spill out onto the floor]

GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

[He bends down and starts picking up her things]

ELSA: Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!

GEORGE: I, I, here let me, let me help you.

ELSA: No no, it's alright.

[She begins helping him pick her things up]

GEORGE: It, it's just that I'm here with my parents and my mother wants me to take a civil service test and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it, so...

[George hands the last of the items to her. She takes them from him, then starts to admire his hand]

ELSA: Hmm.

GEORGE: What?

[She looks at both his hands intensely]

ELSA: Your hands.

GEORGE: What about them?

ELSA: They're quite exquisite!

GEORGE: They are?

ELSA: Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?

GEORGE: Hand modeling?

[He shakes his head "No"]

[She fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George]

ELSA: Here's my card. Why don't you uh, give me a call?

[She walks off]

[George looks at the card. A shot of the card is shown saying "Specialty Models"]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[George is holding up his hands for Jerry to see]

JERRY: I, I don't get it.

GEORGE: Me neither!

JERRY: What is it?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: They're hands!

GEORGE: This woman just set me up for a job!

[Jerry gets up and displays his own hands]

JERRY: Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.

GEORGE: What, are you kidding?

[He points at the flaws of Jerry's hands]

GEORGE: The knuckles are all out of proportion, you got hair over there. Where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one in a million hand.

[He points to his own hand]

JERRY: Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.

GEORGE: This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking. I couldn't take it any more. I get up from the table and I bop into this woman.

JERRY: It's just like in the movies.

[Kramer enters]

[He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey, George!

[He holds out his hand. George shakes it and a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs]

GEORGE: Oh!! What are you, crazy?! Are you crazy?!

KRAMER: What?!

GEORGE: You could have damaged my hand!

KRAMER: But it's just a toy!

JERRY: George has become a hand model.

KRAMER: A hand model?

JERRY: Yes.

KRAMER: Really? Let me see your hands.

GEORGE: You can look at them, but do not touch them.

[He holds them out]

KRAMER: Let's see. Oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth... creamy... delicate, yet masculine.

[George takes two oven mitts from his back pack]

GEORGE: Alright.

[He puts them on]

GEORGE: I gotta get going.

JERRY: Oven mitts?

GEORGE: That's all I could find. Would you mind getting the door?

JERRY: Yeah, yeah.

[Jerry opens the door for George]

GEORGE: Thank you very much.

[He walks out]

[Jerry shuts the door then starts going through his mail]

KRAMER: You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.

JERRY: Uh huh.

[Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up]

JERRY: Since I what?

KRAMER: Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.

[He starts unzipping the suit cover]

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show.

[He takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover]

JERRY: This?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: I agreed to wear this?!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

JERRY: But, when did I do that?

KRAMER: When we went to dinner the other night.

JERRY: What are you, crazy?!

KRAMER: What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?

JERRY: I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!

KRAMER: There you go.

JERRY: Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV and I said "Yes"?

KRAMER: Yes, yes! You said it!

JERRY: But I, I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!

[Kramer takes it off the hook and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it]

KRAMER: Well, she asked you.

JERRY: I, I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!

KRAMER: Well you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already making them.

JERRY: They're making these?

KRAMER: Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with Jerry. This, this is gonna be the new look for the nineties. You're gonna be the first pirate!

JERRY: But, I don't want to be a pirate!


[At the Costanza's house]

[George is giving himself a manicure over a tray. He's carefully primping his fingernails]

ESTELLE: I knew it. I knew it. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?

FRANK: Who the hell did you ever mention his hands to?

ESTELLE: I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!

FRANK: You never mentioned it to me!

[George snaps, then points to the coffee table]

GEORGE: Hand me an Emory board.

[Estelle hands an Emory board to George. He takes it, then goes back to his manicure]

ESTELLE: I always talk about your hands, how they're so soft and milky white.

FRANK: No! You never said milky white!

ESTELLE: I said milky white!

[A moment passes as George fights to keep his temper down around his parents]

GEORGE: Scissor.

[She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him]

GEORGE: Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!

[Estelle, visibly nervous, reacts, flipping the scissors around]

ESTELLE: I'm sorry.

GEORGE: You're sorry?!

ESTELLE: I'll try to be more careful.

GEORGE: I hope so.

[He takes the scissors]

[Another moment passes as George primps his hands]

ESTELLE: Georgie.

[She nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors]

ESTELLE: Georgie, would you like some Jello?

FRANK: Why'd you put the bananas in there?!

ESTELLE: George likes the bananas!

FRANK: So let him have bananas on the side!

[George stands up with the manicure tray. He's obviously had enough]

GEORGE: Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering! Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning. My hands have got to be in tip top shape so please keep the television down and the conversation to a minimum.

ESTELLE: But Georgie, what about the Jello?

GEORGE: I'll take it in my room.

[He walks off]


[At the Today Show dressing room]

[Jerry's in a back room getting dressed while Kramer's thumbing through a magazine. There's a knock at the door]

KRAMER: Yeah, come in.

[A Today Show stagehand enters]

STAGEHAND: I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.

KRAMER: Giddy up.

[Stagehand leaves]

KRAMER: Jerry! Five minutes!

[Jerry walks out from the back room wearing the puffy shirt. He has the expression of extreme resentment]

KRAMER: Now that's a great looking shirt! Aye Captain!

[He growls like a pirate]

KRAMER: Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.

[Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt]

KRAMER: Look at it! It's fantastic!

JERRY: Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I, I can't wear this!

KRAMER: Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time everybody's gonna be wearing the pirate look!

[A knock at the door. Kramer answers it, it's Elaine]

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Hi, Kramer. Guess what? I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!

KRAMER: Great.

[Elaine stops in her tracks when she sees Jerry in the shirt. Then bursts out laughing hysterically]

ELAINE: What is that?!

KRAMER: It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? What do you think? Is it cool or what?

ELAINE: Why are you wearing this now?

JERRY: Why am I wearing is now? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now. Because the low talker asked me to, that's why! And I said yes. Do you know why? Because I couldn't hear her!

ELAINE: When did she, when did she ask you this?

JERRY: When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.

ELAINE: I didn't hear anything.

JERRY: Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!

ELAINE: Well you can't wear that on the show.

KRAMER: Elaine, you want to stop?

ELAINE: What, what? No. Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to clothe homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up! You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!

JERRY: I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV. They're producing them as we speak!

ELAINE: Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna swing in on a chandelier!

[A knock at the door, Jerry answers]

[A stagehand enters]

STAGEHAND: Okay, let's go.

[He looks up and points at Jerry's puffy shirt]

STAGEHAND: Is that what you're wearing?


[At a photographer's studio]

[George is holding out his hands while a man and woman marvel at them. A photographer is fooling around with a camera towards the right wall]

HANDMAN: I've never seen hands like these before.

ELSA: They're so soft and milky white.

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: You know who's hands they remind me of? Ray McKigney.

[The woman nods as the man looks off into space]

HANDMAN: Uh. Ray.

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: He was it.

GEORGE: Who was he?

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: The most exquisite hands you've ever seen. Oh, he had it all.

GEORGE: What happened to him?

[Obviously a touchy subject, the woman coyly walks over to the photographer and they both occupy themselves. The man is left to tell George the answer to his question]

HANDMAN: Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world, but none could match the beauty of his own hand and that became his one true love.

[Long pause]

GEORGE: You mean, uh?

HANDMAN: Yes. He was not master of his domain.

[George makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods] 

GEORGE: But how... uh...

HANDMAN: The muscles became so strained with overuse that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position and he was left with nothing but a claw. 
[He holds up his hand displaying a claw-like shape]

HANDMAN: He traveled the world seeking a cure, acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis, nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen that he was unable to manipulate utensils and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor.

[George looks down at his hands]

HANDMAN: I uh, only hope you have a little more self control.

GEORGE: You don't have to worry about me. I won a contest.

[The man nods, unsure of what to say or do]

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, let's get to work


[At the Today show]

[Jerry's in the guest chair, and Bryant Gumbel's in the interviewer's spot. Jerry does not want to be there]

BRYANT: Back now, seven forty-six. On Tuesday the nineteenth here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries, a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, good morning.

JERRY: Thank you, Bryant.

BRYANT: And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.

JERRY: Oh, thank you.

[Backstage, Kramer's standing with his girlfriend. She's brimming with pride]

BRYANT: You're all kind of, kind of "puffed up".

[He chuckles]

JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.

BRYANT: You look kind of like a pirate.

[Elaine, also standing backstage, closes her eyes showing her dissatisfaction]

JERRY: Yeah, like a pirate. Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to um, raise enough money... with this... uh...

BRYANT: You ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a very unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you, you know. You could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate comedian.

JERRY: Uh huh, yeah.

BRYANT: Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?

JERRY: Look, it's not my shirt.

BRYANT: Whose shirt is it?

JERRY: What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's, it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen to be perfectly honest with you.

[Off camera, Leslie yells]

LESLIE: You bastard!

BRYANT: Did you hear that?

JERRY: That I heard.


[At the photographer's studio]

[George is modeling a watch as the man and woman stand by. The photographer is setting the camera]

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: All right, a little to the left, little higher, little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect.

GEORGE: Like that?

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: Just like that. Hold it.

[He takes a picture]

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: Good, okay, let me get just one more, one more. 
[He takes another picture]

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: Good, that's it. You're done.

GEORGE: That's it?

HANDPHOTOGRAPHER: That's it.

[The man pulls a slip of paper out of his coat pocket]

HANDMAN: And here's your check. Thank you very much.

[He pats George on the back]

HANDMAN: It was an honor.

ELSA: It was great working with you. Your hands are beautiful.

GEORGE: Oh, thank you very much.

ELSA: You know, I was wondering if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together?


[At the Park]

[George skipping along the city park path, dancing with his arms all the way up, rejoicing]


[At the Today show dressing room]

[Jerry, still in the puffy shirt, is getting yelled at by Leslie. Kramer's trying to calm her down, she's hysterical]

LESLIE: You ruined me! You ruined my career!

JERRY: Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.

LESLIE: Oh, I don't give a damn!

JERRY: You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!

[Leslie, deeply let down, finds comfort in Kramer as they go back and sit together on a sofa. George enters, ecstatic]

GEORGE: Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check!

[He hands it to Jerry]

GEORGE: They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives except for this McKigney guy. This great looking girl gave me her phone number. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!

ELAINE: Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.

GEORGE: Alright.

[He holds them up]

ELAINE: Yeah, real nice.

[George turns back to Jerry and takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing and snickers, pointing]

GEORGE: Nice shirt. What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?

[Leslie is in full attention of what George is saying, quietly steaming]

JERRY: Yeah.

[Kramer notices Leslie's state of mind]

GEORGE: What, have you completely lost your mind?

KRAMER: Hey..

GEORGE: Who's dressing you?

[He laughs]

GEORGE: You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my...

[Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony. His voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling]


[At a restaurant]

[George's hands are completely bandaged up. Elaine's stirring a cup of coffee for him]

ELAINE: You ready?

[George nods. She holds the cup up to his mouth, he takes a sip]

GEORGE: Ow! Hot! Hot!

ELAINE: I'm sorry.

GEORGE: This McKigney guy had a few good years. How could you forget to turn off an iron?

KRAMER: Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.

GEORGE: My whole life is ruined because of the "Puffy shirt".

JERRY: It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for, "Avast ye matey." What the hell does that mean?! "Twenty degrees off the starboard side, the Spanish Galleon!" There's no comeback for that!

ELAINE: Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.

KRAMER: You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. We're finished.

JERRY: Really? What happened?

KRAMER: I just can't be with someone whose life is in complete disarray.

JERRY: What happened with all the shirts?

KRAMER: They gave them all to Goodwill.

[Finished, they all exit the cafe. George is muttering "puffy shirt... puffy shirt..." as they meet up with two homeless men dressed in the puffy shirts with their hands out begging for some change. George shows his two bandaged hands, then walks off with Elaine]

HOMELESSMAN: Ah, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?

[While digging in his pocket for some money, Jerry looks over the shirts one last time]

JERRY: You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt.


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: Why do we always have to say, "Excuse me" when we can't hear what someone is saying? Why are we so guilty and so apologetic? "Excuse me, pardon me, I'm sorry." Why can't once I go, "Nope, not loud enough." Why can't I do that? Just once I would like to have the guts, you know to make that judgment, someone mumbles something you go, "Your fault. I'm not sorry because it's your fault."
