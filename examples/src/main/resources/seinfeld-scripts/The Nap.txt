[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: Oh boy, I was up till four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.

ELAINE: Mmm.

JERRY: That's good stuff.

GEORGE: I can't keep doing this to myself. I'm exhausted.

JERRY: Can't you grab a nap at work?

GEORGE: Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. Sometimes that's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see you.

[George leaves]

ELAINE: Bye.

JERRY: So what are you doing now?

ELAINE: Oh, I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.

JERRY: With a gentleman caller?

ELAINE: Yes, his name is Hal.

JERRY: The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the person.

ELAINE: Hey, it's the next best thing to being alone.

[Kramer enters with a wet head]

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Hey. Shower?

KRAMER: No, pool. I just swam two hundred laps.

ELAINE: You are kidding.

KRAMER: Look at hose babies.

[He shows his hands to Elaine]

KRAMER: They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to your place.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?

JERRY: Slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.

ELAINE: Hey Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right? What exactly was that kid?

KRAMER: Oh, Damien?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

KRAMER: Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.


[At Yankee Stadium]

[George is trying to take a nap at his desk behind a large hardback book. Wilhelm enters]

WILHELM: Ah George.

[George quickly puts the book down]

WILHELM: Have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book.

GEORGE: Right here.

[Mr. Wilhelm takes the book]

WILHELM: Ah, thanks kiddo.

[George sighs and leans back in his chair. He leans down and picks a piece of paper off the floor beside his desk. Leaning down again he peers inside the space under his desk. A thought occurs to him]


[At Central Park]

HAL: You know Twinkies aren't cooked?

ELAINE: It looks cooked, it's dark on the bottom.

HAL: It’s just the way it is, it’s a substance.

ELAINE: Well I don't care, they're delicious. Wanna sit down?

HAL: Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.

ELAINE: Really?

HAL: I threw my back out about fifteen years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I buy all my furniture at the ergonomics store.

ELAINE: Oh, those places have the stupidest names. Like uh, like "Back in Business " or "Good Vertibrations".

HAL: Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".


[At Jerry's Apartment]

CONRAD: Oh Jerry, are you okay with this hinge?

JERRY: Yeah.

CONRAD: I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all.

JERRY: You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?

CONRAD: Oh, these are different.

JERRY: Drop one... left!

[George enters]

GEORGE: Jerry, look at my eyes.

JERRY: A little less beady today.

GEORGE: Because I'm refreshed. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.

JERRY: Sounds like a really cool fort.

CONRAD: Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?

JERRY: I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.

GEORGE: Conrad, is it?

CONRAD: Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer.

GEORGE: Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?

JERRY: He's kind of tied up here.

GEORGE: It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?

CONRAD: There is no normal, whatever Jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he...

JERRY: Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?

CONRAD: Whatever you want.


[At Jerry's apartment the next day on the telephone]

JERRY: So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal?

ELAINE: Uh, it was okay. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the TV.

[There's a knock on the door]

ELAINE: I gotta go someone's at my door.

[She hangs up]

ELAINE: Yeah!

DELIVERYGUY: Delivery. Elaine Benes?

ELAINE: Yeah.

DELIVERYGUY: We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress.

ELAINE: Mattress? I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this?

[She reads the invoice]

ELAINE: Hal Kitzmiller?


[At Yankee Stadium]

[Conrad is working on George's desk]

GEORGE: Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like uh, for an alarm clock?

[Conrad holds his hands apart]

CONRAD: You mean like that big?

[George holds his hands a little closer together]

GEORGE: Like this.

CONRAD: Yeah, I can do that.

GEORGE: Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for like a blanket?

CONRAD: Blanket or quilt?

GEORGE: Blanket.

CONRAD: That thick?

GEORGE: Maybe like this.

CONRAD: Like that?

GEORGE: Yeah, like that.

CONRAD: If that is what you want.

GEORGE: That is what I want.


[Later in George's office]

CONRAD: Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left or the right or the middle?

GEORGE: Whatever!!

[Conrad drills the final hole into the desk to install the cup holder. George examines his work]

GEORGE: Ho ho ho ho, this is unbelievable! This is better than my bed at home!

[He hands Conrad a check]

GEORGE: Alright, it’s been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.

CONRAD: If that's what you want.

GEORGE: That's what I want.

[Conrad exits. Mr. Wilhelm walks by]

WILHELM: Morning George.

GEORGE: Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.

[George stretches and escapes under his desk for a nap]


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: I got pool problems Jerry.

JERRY: What happened?

KRAMER: Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real groove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics. Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.

JERRY: How long did that last?

KRAMER: A half hour, then diving class started. Well, that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim because that pool can't hold me, Jerry.

[Elaine enters]

JERRY: How was the movie?

ELAINE: I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.

JERRY: Why?

ELAINE: He's got a back problem.

JERRY: So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.

ELAINE: After one date!

KRAMER: What's that guy's last name again?

ELAINE: Kitzmiller.

KRAMER: Oh, that's right.

JERRY: So what are you going to do with the mattress?

ELAINE: I don't know. Chuck it?

KRAMER: Oh, no no no no, I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.

ELAINE: Oh, alright.

KRAMER: My old one sprung a leak.

ELAINE: You have a water bed?

KRAMER: Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.

[Kramer and Elaine exit. Conrad enters]

CONRAD: Hi Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways.

JERRY: How about this? Finish this thing up today!

CONRAD: Couple of questions for you.

JERRY: No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.

CONRAD: Alright Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.

JERRY: Just... do it.

[Jerry leaves]


[At George's office]

[Mr. Steinbrenner enters]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Costanza? Where's Costanza? Excuse mois? Have you seen Costanza?

[George awakens from his nap under the desk]

SECRETARY: I've seen him around.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Hmm, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I got to know the name of that. "She's a heart breaker, love taker. Oh. Oh"

[He sits down in front of George's desk]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Very catchy tune, very very catchy. Well, you know what? I can't sit and wait for that guy.

[He picks up a magazine]

MRSTEINBRENNER: What is this, People? Hmm, the most beautiful people People. Ally Selica, nothing wrong with that uh?

[George looks real worried about his predicament]


[At Monk's Cafe]

HAL: Elaine, you’re taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what I intended.

ELAINE: Well, what did you intend, Hal?

HAL: I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.

ELAINE: Custom designed?

HAL: They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about one hundred ten pounds?

ELAINE: Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.

HAL: So you do like the mattress?

ELAINE: Oh, I love it. I'm glad... I kept it.


[Beside the East River]

[A father is showing his little boy the sights]

FATHER: Over there, that's Brooklyn. That's where Spike Lee lives.

[The boy is looking through some binoculars]

SON: Hey, there's a man swimming in the water.

FATHER: Nah, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they throw the body in the river.


[In Jerry's hallway]

KRAMER: Jer.

JERRY: Hi.

KRAMER: Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.

JERRY: What is that smell?

KRAMER: That's East River.

JERRY: You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?

KRAMER: Technically Norfolk has more gross tonnage.

JERRY: How could you swim in that water?

KRAMER: I saw a couple of other guys out there.

JERRY: Swimming?

KRAMER: Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.

[Jerry goes into his apartment. He looks at the new kitchen cabinets. They're huge a take up half the apartment]


[At Elaine's apartment, she's on the phone]

ELAINE: Hey Kramer, its Elaine. Thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you whenever. Alright, bye.

[She sits on the matress]

ELAINE: Oh, this is a good mattress.

[She notices a smell and bends over to smell the mattress]

ELAINE: Ugh!

[The smell makes her recoil in disgust]


[In George's office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Where the hell is this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours for crying out loud. Should I go? No way Jack! I'm not hung up at the register again, I'll tell you that.

SECRETARY: Mr. Steinbrenner?

MRSTEINBRENNER: That's what they call me.

SECRETARY: Your grandchildren are here to see you.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Oh well, send them in. Send the tykes in.

[Three little kids and a dog come running in]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Look at you little kids. who are you people? How about a ride on the Pony Express? Get up here.

[From under the desk, George slowly picks up the phone to make a call]

MRSTEINBRENNER: What's your name? Shorty? Mel? Are you Mel?

[At Jerry's apartment. The phone rings]

JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help me.

JERRY: Who is this?

GEORGE: Jerry!

[A small kid finds George under his desk]

BRADY: Hi.

GEORGE: Shh, shh, goodbye, shh, get away.

BRADY: Hi, I'm Brady.

GEORGE: Get away.

JERRY: Why don't you just have him paged?

GEORGE: Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.

JERRY: A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?

GEORGE: Just call!

JERRY: I should have some reason.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Hey you kids know tunes? See if this song rings a bell, "Heartbreaker..."

SECRETARY: Mr. Steinbrenner? We just received a call. There's a bomb in the building.

MRSTEINBRENNER: A bomb in the building? Oh my God. Quick, everyone under the desk.


[At Steinbrenner's office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies?

GEORGE: I'm sorry sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.

GEORGE: What?

MRSTEINBRENNER: You knew about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.


[At Jerry's new renovated apartment]

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: What the hell is this? Where are you?

JERRY: Over here. You can see right through here.

ELAINE: What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.

JERRY: It's kind of cozy.

ELAINE: Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.

JERRY: Does it smell like the East River?

ELAINE: How did you know?

JERRY: Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.

ELAINE: Oh, great!

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.

ELAINE: Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.

KRAMER: Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld... What the hell happened here?

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.

ELAINE: It is obtrusive, isn't it?

KRAMER: It is very obtrusive.

JERRY: I don't think it's that bad.

KRAMER: You can't get a stool in here.

JERRY: No, the stools go over there.

KRAMER: No, that's no good. I'm leaving.

ELAINE: I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.

GEORGE: Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?

JERRY: You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.

GEORGE: Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.

JERRY: Hey, look at you.

GEORGE: Yeah, look at me. Now I gotta figure out the hat size of fifty-nine thousand different people!! What if a pinhead shows up? I gotta be on top of that!

JERRY: No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.

GEORGE: Knock offs?! I am not going to do it! An you're going to call Steinbrenner back and cancel the whole thing!!

JERRY: Could you at least get a hat for me?

GEORGE: Fine! What size!

JERRY: Seven and five eighths

GEORGE: Seven and five eighths!!

JERRY: Why are you shouting?

GEORGE: I don't know! It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.


[At Elaine's apartment]

HAL: So are you liking the mattress?

ELAINE: I am totally loving it. Uh, you know, we should um, get going.

HAL: What is that smell?

ELAINE: What smell?

HAL: I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.

ELAINE: No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.

HAL: Claming?

ELAINE: Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.


[At Steinbrenner's office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Yes yes, come in.

GEORGE: Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Just let me ask you something. Is it "February" or "Febuary"? Because I prefer "Febuary" and what is this "ru"?

[The phone rings]

GEORGE: Let me put that on speaker phone.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Hello, are you the bomber?

JERRY: Yes, this is the terrorist bomber.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.

JERRY: Think I've changed my mind.

MRSTEINBRENNER: You don't want them, then goodbye.

GEORGE: Yes sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well what do you want instead?

JERRY: What?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something.

JERRY: I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Alright George, you can handle that.

[George hangs up the phone]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Costanza what the hell are you doing?

GEORGE: You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.

MRSTEINBRENNER: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous.


[On the street]

ELAINE: Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. Cheese crust pizza.

HAL: It's just more cheese.

ELAINE: I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!

KRAMER: Oh, hey.

ELAINE: Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.

KRAMER: Hal... uh Langerhans.

HAL: Kitzmiller.

KRAMER: Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right

ELAINE: You feeling jiff?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm jiff.

HAL: That smell.

KRAMER: Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.

ELAINE: Oh, baby.


[Under George's desk]

[The alarm clock rings. George turns it off]

GEORGE: Finished.


[At the East River]

HAL: Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?

KRAMER: Yeah sure, um, oh boy.

HAL: Kitzmiller.

KRAMER: That's it.

HAL: You and Elaine are pretty close.

KRAMER: Oh, we go back a ways.

HAL: And you've, how do I put this? You've been in her bed?

KRAMER: That's right.

HAL: But this isn't still going on.

KRAMER: No no, she put a stop to that.

HAL: That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.

HAL: Great for the back. Right.

KRAMER: Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. Giddy up.

[He dives into the river]


[Ay George's office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: "Heartbreaker, Brew baker". Hey George, I remember that tune. George? George?

[He hears George's alarm clock under the desk]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Um, what's that ticking? Oh oh. Oh, oh, whoa whoa wha whoa.

[He runs out]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Fire in the hole!


[At Elaine's apartment]

[Elaine is trying to move the mattress]

ELAINE: I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ugh.

[The mattress falls on top of her]

ELAINE: Oh, okay.


[At Jerry's apartment]

CONRAD: You want it back the way it was?

JERRY: Yeah, that's right.

CONRAD: You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision.

[The phone rings]

JERRY: One second. Hello?

ELAINE: Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.

JERRY: Just lie down.

ELAINE: I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.

JERRY: Alright. I'll be right there. Conrad I gotta go.

CONRAD: Stay, go, whatever.


[At the East River with Hall and more people]

HAL: Hey, Kramer.

KRAMER: What's going on?

HAL: I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.

OLDMAN: Step aside.

[He jumps in the river]

KRAMER: He just sunk like a stone.


[At Steinbrenner's office]

GEORGE: Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. Alright boys send it in

[The bomb disposal robot enters George's office]

MRSTEINBRENNER: What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one.

[The robot exposes a girlie magazine in the top drawer]

MRSTEINBRENNER: So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?

BOMBCOP: Looks like there's more compartments underneath.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let her rip.

[The robot cuts through George's desk with a chain saw]

MRSTEINBRENNER: I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables.


[In the East River]

[The river is now crowded with people swimming]

KRAMER: Hey, watch where you're kicking!

ELAINE: Kramer.

KRAMER: Elaine?

ELAINE: I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Yeah.


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Hi Connie, Jerry around?

CONRAD: No, and I prefer "Conrad". So I heard what happened to the desk.

GEORGE: There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.

CONRAD: Yeah, well, whatever. See you.


[Later at Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry enters]

JERRY: Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks.

[He opens the cabinet and puts a box on the shelf. George is seen sleeping on the second shelf inside the cabinet. Jerry doesn't notice this and closes the cabinet door. He turns and stops for a moment, thinking. He then turns back and opens the cabinet door and retrieves the box to examine it]

JERRY: I can't believe I got the low fat!
