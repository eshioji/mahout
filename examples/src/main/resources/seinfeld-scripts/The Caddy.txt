[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I don't know why people are surprised when someone gets hit in the head with a golf ball. Do you ever watch these tournaments on TV? You got six hundred people crowding around a hole that big and no one can believe it when a Titleist gets bounced off of someone's coconut. You know you throw a rock into a crowd, that's considered terrorism. But if you have a nice follow through.

[He makes a pretend golf swing]

JERRY: You know that's golf. I'm always impressed actually with the golf cameraman whose job is to follow the golf ball when it's in the sky. You know what I mean? It's a little white ball, it's doing a hundred miles an hour on a white background. "I got it, I lost it, I got it, I lost it, I got it, I lost it." Why bother? Aim the camera at the sky, aim it at the ground, take a ball out of you pocket, throw it down. Who's gonna know where the hell it came from?


[At Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: How did you lock your keys in the car?

GEORGE: How? Because I'm an idiot.

JERRY: So why don't you get a locksmith?

GEORGE: I was going to but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.

JERRY: How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?

GEORGE: I don't know, about three days.

[Kramer enters with his golf clubs]

KRAMER: Hello boys.

JERRY: You're not playing golf?

KRAMER: Yes indeed. The calendar says winter, but the gods of spring are out.

GEORGE: Are the courses open?

KRAMER: No no, I'm sneaking in with Stan the caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.

GEORGE: Huh, no kidding?

KRAMER: Yeah, and I'll tell you something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.

JERRY: Really, you're getting that good?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm the real deal.

[Knocking is heard from outside in the hallway]

KRAMER: Yeah, here Stan, in here!

[Stan enters]

KRAMER: There he is, yeah Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

GEORGE: How you doing?

JERRY: Hi.

STAN: Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, Kramer?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, you betcha.

STAN: What are those ah, cotton pants?

KRAMER: Yeah yeah. Why, is it too cold out?

STAN: Here's what you do. You bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.

KRAMER: Ah, that makes sense. That's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah, we'll see you.

[Kramer and Stan leave]

[Together with arms extended and palms upwards]

GEORGE: Stan the caddy.

JERRY: Stan the caddy.


[On the street]

SUEELLEN: Elaine?

[Elaine turns to see Sue Ellen waving her hand]

SUEELLEN: Hi!

ELAINE: Oh great, it's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.

SUEELLEN: I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.  

ELAINE: Yeah. What have you been up to?

SUEELLEN: I've just been hanging out.

ELAINE: I see.

SUEELLEN: Hmm. Oh listen, I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.

ELAINE: Oh tomorrow?  

SUEELLEN: Uh huh.

ELAINE: I don't know if I can.

SUEELLEN: No?

ELAINE: Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.

SUEELLEN: Oh, that's too bad.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.

SUEELLEN: Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.

[Elaine Laughs]


[At Yankee Stadium]

WILHELM: George!?

[He drops a paper airplane he was holding]

GEORGE: Mr. Wilhelm!

WILHELM: I'm sorry to interrupt you but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in. Oh and ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So keep it under your hat!


[At Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He could be asking my advice on trades! Trades Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!

JERRY: That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in fifteen years.

GEORGE: And it is all because of that car.

[Shot of Steinbrenner's car pulling into his parking space and getting out of the car with Costanza's car in the background]

GEORGE: See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in.

[Night shot of Wilhelm walking out to the parking lot, he sees George's car and nods approvingly]

GEORGE: Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them they think I'm working an eighteen hour day!

JERRY: Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey, how you doing?!?

ELAINE: Better, now.

JERRY: Yeah, what happened?

ELAINE: You know Sue Ellen Mischke?

JERRY: Sue Ellen Mischke?  

ELAINE: Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year.

JERRY: Sounds familiar.

ELAINE: The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

JERRY: Oh yeah, you mentioned her.

ELAINE: Yes. Yes. I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever as long as I have known her worn a bra.

GEORGE: Ah, that is disgusting.

JERRY: That is just shameless, I don't know, there's no...

GEORGE: She's a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her?

JERRY: It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.

GEORGE: It's disgusting.

ELAINE: Alright, there's no...

GEORGE: Come on! Come on.

JERRY: We're only kidding!

ELAINE: You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school.

[Flashback sequence]

ELAINE: I was at this party and I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley by the way, and she goes walking by in this little floozy outfit and he follows her right out the door!

JERRY: She's your Lex Luthor!

ELAINE: Her birthday's coming up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.

JERRY: What are you going to get her?

ELAINE: A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.

JERRY: There's nothing subtle about that.

GEORGE: No no, she might just think it's a gift.

JERRY: Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?


[At Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE: Ah, hey Ho.

JERRY: What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?

GEORGE: Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days. Her parents rebuilt the cabin!  

JERRY: So, you're just taking off from work?

GEORGE: Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.

JERRY: Do you think this is such a good idea with you being on the verge of this big promotion?

GEORGE: My presence in that office can only hurt my chances.


[Elaine's office at J. Peterman]

[The receptionist is heard on the intercom, "Sue Ellen Mischke to see you."]

ELAINE:  Sue Ellen Mischke?  Ah, alright, send her in.

[Sue Ellen enters wearing the brazier as a top with a black blazer]

SUEELLEN: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Hello.

SUEELLEN: I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in and thank you for your lovely gift.

ELAINE: Oh, you're... welcome.

SUEELLEN: Is anything wrong?

ELAINE: Well Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.

SUEELLEN: Oh I know. Thanks again.


[At the Ross's cabin]

GEORGE: This is the life! Isn't it, huh kid?

SUSAN: Wanna check out a swap meet?

GEORGE: Yeah maybe. Where'd you get that?

SUSAN: Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.

[George sits up suddenly realizing something]


[At Jerry's apartment. The phone rings]

[Jerry hits part of the phone receiver with his right hand to make the phone receiver pop up into the air. He grabs it in his left and answers]

JERRY: Hello.

GEORGE: Hey hey, it's George. I need you to do me a favor.

JERRY: What's going on?

GEORGE: I just remembered, there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium that puts flyers on all the cars.

JERRY: Yeah, so?

GEORGE: Alright, this is what you gotta do. I need you to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.

JERRY: You know last time you had me throwing a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?

GEORGE: Alright, fine. I'll drive the three hours each way, six hours all together and take them off myself!!

JERRY: Alright alright, I'll do it!!

[Jerry hangs up. Kramer enters Jerry's apartment eating something]

JERRY: Hey, what are you up to?

KRAMER: Nothing.

JERRY: You wanna go with me up to the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car?

KRAMER: Sure!

JERRY: I guess I could of said just about anything there, couldn't I?

KRAMER: Yep.

[As they turn to go out the door, Kramer walks into the wall where the intercom is Jerry pulls the door shut and Kramer avoids touching any part of the door, he turns quickly as it shuts]


[At the Yankee Stadium parking lot]

[George's windshield has a lot of flyers on it and the car is covered with bird droppings. A bunch of pigeons are on the roof]

JERRY: Oh man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this? What are we gonna do?

KRAMER: I don't know.

JERRY: Well, we gotta get it washed.

[He pulls off a few flyers]

JERRY: Ah, the keys are locked inside!

KRAMER: Wait a second.

JERRY: What are you gonna do?

KRAMER: I'll just snag the lock with this. Ah, here we go.

JERRY: Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?


[Jerry and Kramer leave the Gentle Touch Car Wash. Kramer is driving George's car]

KRAMER: Well, George has gotta be happy about this.

JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah.

JERRY: Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?

[Sue Ellen is seen walking down the street]

KRAMER:  Oh, mama.

JERRY: Kramer!!!

[Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into]

[Car crash sound]


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: My God, are you okay?

KRAMER: Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.

[He has a large Band-aid on his forehead]

JERRY: I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.

ELAINE: So how did this happen?

JERRY: He was staring at some woman!

KRAMER: Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.

ELAINE: What woman?

JERRY: There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing just a bra.  I can't get that image out of my mind.

ELAINE:  Oh my God.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Was it a tall woman in a black blazer?

JERRY: Yeah!

ELAINE: Oh! That's Sue Ellen Mischke!  

JERRY: Sue Ellen Mischke?

ELAINE: That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top!  The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.

KRAMER: Hey you know my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing?

[Kramer makes a horrible golf swing motion and collapses in pain over the back of the couch]

KRAMER: Oh.

[Stan the caddy enters]

STAN: I got your message, how's the shoulder?

KRAMER: Yeah it's my left arm, I can't swing it!

STAN: Oh no, not the left arm!

KRAMER: Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour and all my dreams?

ELAINE: Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!

KRAMER: Sue her?

ELAINE: Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

KRAMER: Ah, no no no I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.

ELAINE: Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take her for every penny she's got!

KRAMER: What do you think, Stan?

STAN: Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?

[Kramer smiles]


[At Jackie Chiles office]

JACKIECHILES: So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend minding your own business?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JACKIECHILES: Then what happened?

KRAMER: Well then we saw this woman and she was wearing a bra with no top.

JACKIECHILES: No top?  She didn't have a top on?  

KRAMER: Yeah. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.

JACKIECHILES: Well how would you describe this woman?  Would you say she was an attractive woman?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.

JACKIECHILES: So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walking around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!  

KRAMER: She was flouting.

JACKIECHILES: That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!

KRAMER: It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

JACKIECHILES: Could you repeat that?

KRAMER: I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

JACKIECHILES: O'Henry? That's one of our top selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?

KRAMER: No.

JACKIECHILES: Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.

KRAMER: So what do you think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?

JACKIECHILES: Like taking candy from a baby.

[Kramer mouths “Oh Yeah” then motions his hand in a circle and clicks]


[At the cabin]

GEORGE: I think I got it. How about this? How about this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams for Barry Bonds, huh?  What do you think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds in the same outfield! Now you got a team!

SUSAN: I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.

GEORGE: Oh, would you stop worrying?  

SUSAN: Well, what about the flyers?

GEORGE: Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.


[At the Yankee Stadium parking lot]

[Jerry is having difficulty parking the car. Lots of smoke is coming from the vehicle. After getting the car in the space and hitting the Costanza parking sign, Jerry leans against the door trying to close it. Finally he gives up and leaves, kicking a piece of the car under it as he goes]


[At Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Come in!

[Wilhelm enters]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Ah, Wilhelm.

WILHELM: Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.

MRSTEINBRENNER: How about a good morning?

WILHELM: Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Good morning to you, Wilhelm.

WILHELM: Uh anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident and trooper that he is he tried to make it into work, sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Alright Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen.

WILHELM: Yes sir.

[He starts backing up to the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Put everyone on alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find that kid.  

WILHELM: Yes sir, yes sir.

[Opening the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: We must find George.

WILHELM: Yes sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Find him, Wilhelm!

[Wilhelm closes the door]

WILHELM: Yes sir.


[In the hallway in Jerry's building]

[As Jerry walks down the hall to his apartment he finds Sue Ellen knocking on Kramer's door]

SUEELLEN: Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?

JERRY: Yes, yes I do.

SUEELLEN: Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?

JERRY: No, I don't.

SUEELLEN: Oh.

JERRY: Is there something I can help you with?

SUEELLEN: No, I really just needed to speak with him.

JERRY: Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.

SUEELLEN: Oh, well maybe I will.

[Jerry quickly unlocks his door before she can change her mind]

SUEELLEN: If you don't mind.

JERRY: No no, not at all.

SUEELLEN: Thanks.

JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.


[At Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]

MRSTEINBRENNER: What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in.

WILHELM: Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere, there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Oh my God. Do you know what this means, Wilhelm?  

WILHELM: What sir?

MRSTEINBRENNER: He's dead! Costanza's dead!

WILHELM: No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think...

MRSTEINBRENNER: Oh, as quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy, easy big Stein, get it together. Okay Wilhelm.

WILHELM: Yes sir?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Find out where his parents live.

WILHELM: Parents.

MRSTEINBRENNER: I'm gonna personally notify them and ah, line up some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position.

WILHELM: Yes sir.

[He starts backing up to the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: We can't grieve forever!  

WILHELM: Right. Yes sir.

MRSTEINBRENNER: We gotta get back to business!  

WILHELM: Yes Sir!

[He closes the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Back to business Wilhelm!

WILHELM: Yes sir!


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Kramer enters. He still has the Band-aid on his forehead]

KRAMER: Well buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!

JERRY: Oh really?

KRAMER: Why, what's wrong, come on?

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Uh.

JERRY: So the woman was walking around in a bra.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: I mean it's no big deal. You're still driving. You should have been watching the road.

KRAMER: Well, your attitude has certainly changed.

JERRY: I don't think my attitude has changed.

KRAMER: Now listen Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.

JERRY: Well, I don't know if I...

KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!

JERRY: Kramer I don't think I can.

KRAMER: Listen, this is a million dollars we're talking about Jerry. Now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team Jerry!

JERRY: Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it Kramer.

KRAMER: Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?

JERRY: Nothing's happened.

KRAMER: God.

[As Kramer begins to leave he notices an O'Henry wrapper in the garbage can]

KRAMER: Oh, what's this?

JERRY: Oh no no no, wait a second, wait a second, that...

KRAMER: Oh I see, yes. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?

JERRY: Kramer, it is not what you think.

KRAMER: Ah ah ah! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger and now you're willing to sell me and Elaine and whoever else you have to right down the river.

JERRY: And what about you?!? Trying to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard working Americans!

KRAMER: You're just out for sex!!

JERRY: You're just out for money!!

[Together]

KRAMER: Ah ah ah!!

JERRY: Ah ah ah!!


[At the Costanza's house]

[Steinbrenner knocks on the door. Estelle opens the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Mrs. Costanza?

ESTELLE: Yes?

MRSTEINBRENNER: My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.

[Estelle gasps]


[In the Costanza's living room]

ESTELLE: I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human dynamo.

ESTELLE: Are you sure you're talking about George?

MRSTEINBRENNER: You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?

FRANK: What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had thirty home runs and over one hundred RBI's last year. He's got a rocket for an arm. You don't know what the hell you're doing!!

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps bat. They kept saying, "Ken Phelps, Ken Phelps."


[Jerry is entering his apartment as Frank is leaving a message on his answering machine]

JERRY: I'm not here, leave a message.

FRANK: Jerry, its Frank Costanza. Mr. Steinbrenner's here, George is dead, call me back!

[The phone rings again. Jerry takes off his coat and throws his keys on the table]

JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Hey, it's George.  

JERRY: Where have you been?!?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at your house, they think you're dead!

GEORGE: Dead?  

JERRY: Yeah, and we had an accident with your car. It's a, it's a little crumpled.

GEORGE: My car's a little crumpled?!?

JERRY: Yeah yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second. They saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find you, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!

GEORGE: Alright, I gotta head back right away. I'll, I'll, I gotta figure something out here.

JERRY: Well you gotta call your parents.

GEORGE: I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!

JERRY: Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?

GEORGE: Oh! They could use the break!

[George hangs up the phone. Jerry holds the cordless phone away and makes a facial expression like “well that's true.”]


[At Elaine's office at J. Peterman. She is at her desk, Peterman enters]

PETERMAN: Elaine, do you see this?  Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?

ELAINE: Yeah, it's a bra.

PETERMAN: I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.

[He sits on the corner of the desk]

PETERMAN: What exquisite beauty. I ran down the hallway to talk to her but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.

ELAINE: What is this all about?

PETERMAN: I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.  

ELAINE: Oh, oh but...

PETERMAN: We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle. Zelda Fitzgerald and somebody in their twenties, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy. 
[He tosses the bra on Elaine's desk]

PETERMAN: Have it on my desk by the end of the week.

[Peterman leaves as Elaine looks up in disbelief]


[At Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Come in, come in.

[George enters with a bandage on his head and walking with crutches]

GEORGE: Mr. Steinbrenner?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Ah, Ah! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?  

GEORGE: Yeah, it's me sir.  It's been a harrowing few days. Uh, after the car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and puddle water until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.  

GEORGE: Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey and we wouldn't have to give up that much.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.

GEORGE: I didn't get the job?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Well, once you were dead we couldn't just sit on our hands.  We had to make a move.

[Dejected, George turns to leave, no longer walking with he crutches and takes the bandage off his head]

MRSTEINBRENNER: But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this.

[George closes the door]

MRSTEINBRENNER: Chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!


[In a courtroom]

JACKIECHILES: So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mischke, would you say that was correct?

[Elaine is on the witness stand]

ELAINE: Yes, um.

[She leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks]

ELAINE: Yes, that's correct.

[Sue Ellen leans back and smiles at Jerry. Kramer wearing his arm in a sling notices and seems worried]

JACKIECHILES: And you have also brought with you another bra.

[He goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag]

JACKIECHILES: exactly like the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!

ELAINE: Yes, that's correct.

[Kramer is now on the witness stand]

JACKIECHILES: Uh, what was your golf score the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?

KRAMER: Three under par.

[Stan nods proudly]

JACKIECHILES: Oh, three under par. Hmm, that's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?

KRAMER: Well if they're lucky.

[Stan laughs, Elaine and Jerry are also amused. Kramer smiles and nods]

[Jerry is now on the witness stand]

JACKIECHILES: Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of eighty-third Street and Columbus?

JERRY: I... don't remember.

JACKIECHILES: Well did you or did you not see the defendant wearing the bra?

JERRY: I don't know. Maybe.

JACKIECHILES: Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not see this woman wearing a bra?!?

[Shots of Sue Ellen, Kramer, Elaine, and Stan waiting for Jerry's response]

JERRY: Alright alright, I saw her!

[Sue Ellen rolls her head around in disbelief]

JERRY: And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!

[The judge bangs his gavel]

BRAJUDGE: This court will come to order!

JACKIECHILES: No further questions, your honor.

BRAJUDGE: You may step down.

JACKIECHILES: Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.

KRAMER: Yeah yeah. What's your read, Stan?

STAN: You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.

KRAMER: What do you mean?

STAN: Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.

JACKIECHILES: No no no no!  

KRAMER: Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

JACKIECHILES: Stan? Who the hell is Stan?  

KRAMER: He's my caddy.

JACKIECHILES: You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!  

[Kramer motions for him to do it]

JACKIECHILES: Your honor, we request at this time that Miss Mischke... try on the bra.

[The judge bangs the gavel twice]

BRAJUDGE: This court will come to order!  Go ahead Miss Mischke, try it on.

[Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra over her top but it seems too small. She cannot get the clasps to meet in the front]

SUEELLEN: Uh ah, it doesn't fit. I I I can't put it on.

JACKIECHILES: Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothing now, nothing! I've been practicing law for twenty-five years, you're listening to a caddy!  

KRAMER: Okay, okay.

JACKIECHILES: This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bra's gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!

[Jackie raises his hand up]


[In Elaine's office]

[Two women enter wearing bras as tops]

BRAWOMANONE: Oh hey Elaine, how about some lunch?

ELAINE: Oh no, I, I don't think so.

BRAWOMANTWO: Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top. It's a winner.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, thanks.

BRAWOMANONE: Are you sure you don't wanna go?  We have reservations.  

ELAINE: Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting a table.

BRAWOMANONE: Ciao.

BRAWOMANTWO: Bye bye.

[Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head]
