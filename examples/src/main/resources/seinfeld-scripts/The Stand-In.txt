[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go, "What are you doing? Get away, come on." The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? People are just like, "the sun, where's the sun?" It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.

[He acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going]


[Jerry and George are on a bus]

GEORGE: It's just not good, it's not good.

JERRY: It's not good.

GEORGE: I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We go out to eat, we both read newspapers.

JERRY: Well at breakfast everybody reads.

GEORGE: No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.

JERRY: You read during lunch?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Oh, well.

GEORGE: There's nothing to talk about.

JERRY: Yeah, what's there to talk about?

GEORGE: Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.

JERRY: Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?

GEORGE: She knows there is nothing to talk about.

JERRY: At least you'll be talking.

GEORGE: Oh shut up.

[Al comes onto the bus]

AL: Hey, look who's here.

JERRY: Hey, Al.

GEORGE: Hey, Al. How's it going?

AL: Deeply in love. We have so many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night till the sun comes up. So how about you?

GEORGE: Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.

AL: Great girl.

GEORGE: We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.

JERRY: Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

AL: Oh did you hear about Fulton?

JERRY: Yeah.

AL: I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago. Think he'd really like you to come visit.

JERRY: Me?

AL: Yeah, he said he could use a good laugh.

GEORGE: What about me?

AL: He didn't mention you.

[He looks toward the front of the bus]

AL: This is my stop. Uh, see you.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah, see you.

[Al leaves]

GEORGE: Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.

JERRY: Yeah.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and George enter the apartment]

GEORGE: I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.

JERRY: Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.

GEORGE: Nah no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I, I make them feel worse.

JERRY: Oh, stop it.

GEORGE: Yeah, and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?

JERRY: So you're not gonna come?

GEORGE: No, but say hello for me.

[Kramer and Mickey enter]

KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: Hey! Hey Mick.

MICKEY: Hey Jerry.

KRAMER: What's doing?

JERRY: Nothing, what's doing with you?

KRAMER: Same old, same old.

JERRY: George this is Mickey.

GEORGE: Hi, nice to meet you.

[George and Mickey shake hands]

MICKEY: Pleasure.

JERRY: How's work going you guys?

MICKEY: Let’s not even talk about it.

GEORGE: You got a job?

KRAMER: Yeah, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on "All My Children." Mickey, he's a stand in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kid’s father.

MICKEY: But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four two, four three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.

JERRY: How do you stop a kid from growing?

KRAMER: I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.

MICKEY: I offered him cigarettes, but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.

KRAMER: What about lifts?

MICKEY: Out of the question.

GEORGE: Can't you just switch with another midget?

[Mickey grabs the counter with rage on his face. Jerry does a form of gulp]

[Mickey turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him]

MICKEY: Its little people, you got that?

KRAMER: Easy Mickey, easy.

GEORGE: Yep.

KRAMER: Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?

JERRY: I'm going to the hospital to visit Fulton.

KRAMER: Oh, oh well say hello for me.

[Kramer and Mickey leave Jerry's apartment and enter the hallway]

KRAMER: Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.

MICKEY: Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.

KRAMER: You wanna keep your job don't you?

MICKEY: Yeah but...

[Kramer interrupts him]

KRAMER: Ah! No buts.

MICKEY: Kramer.

[Kramer interrupts again]

KRAMER: Ah!


[In Fulton's hospital room]

[Fulton is lying in the hospital bed. Jerry enters]

JERRY: Hey, whoa Fulton. It's me.

FULTON: Hey Jerry, good to see you. I could really use a good laugh.

JERRY: Who couldn’t?

FULTON: I haven't cracked a smile in months.

JERRY: Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking is inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad. First you crack then you chuckle.

[Fulton looks at him not amused]

JERRY: You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other.

[He is nervous under the pressure. Fulton is not finding anything Jerry is saying funny]

JERRY: Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.

FULTON: It's a fine time.

JERRY: Oh, alright, ah well. There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him...


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George and Daphne sitting in a booth reading the paper]

GEORGE: So how were the eggs?

DAPHNE: Eggs are eggs.

GEORGE: Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. By the same token you could say fish is fish. I don't think so. Listen Dophne.

DAPHNE: Daphne.

GEORGE: Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...

DAPHNE: Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?

DAPHNE: He told me not to get involved with you.

GEORGE: What?

DAPHNE: Yeah, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up hurting me.

GEORGE: He said that?

[Daphne shakes her head]

GEORGE: What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.

DAPHNE: Is it true?

GEORGE: Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh, impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.


[At the ABC Studios]

[All My Children Set]

SOAPOPERASON: How long are you going to be away for daddy?

SOAPOPERAFATHER: I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.

SOAPOPERASON: Don't go daddy, don't go.

SOAPOPERAFATHER: Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.

SOAPOPERADIRECTOR: And there's your scene. Stand-ins.

KRAMER: Yo.

STAGEHAND: Alright you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights.

[Mickey and Kramer walk onto the set and get into positions]

[Kramer taps the father on the shoulder] 

KRAMER: That's good work.

MICKEY: How long you going to be away for daddy?

KRAMER: I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.

[Mickey tugs on Kramer's coat]

MICKEY: Don't go daddy, don't... go.

KRAMER: Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.

[Kramer and Mickey go to hug and Kramer's pipe hits Mickey in the face]

MICKEY: Ah! Alright, alright! Kramer!

[He pushes Kramer off him]

SOAPOPERADIRECTOR: Okay everybody, that's lunch, one hour.

[The director pauses and looks at Mickey as if something is different]

KRAMER: How do those lifts feel?

MICKEY: Quiet.

TAMMY: Hi guys.

MICKEY: Hey Tammy.

TAMMY: Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?

MICKEY: Not that I know of.

TAMMY: Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great.

MICKEY: How about lunch?

TAMMY: OH I can't today, but um, I see it our future. See you Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah.

TAMMY: Bye Mickey

KRAMER: Oh she likes you buddy.

[They do a high five hand shake]

MICKEY: Yeah!

JOHNNY: Hey Mick.

MICKEY: How you doing Johnny?

JOHNNY: What gives, what's going on? Going out with Tammy?

MICKEY: Maybe. What's it to you?

JOHNNY: Something different about you.

MICKEY: I got my hair cut that's all.

JOHNNY: Nah, that's not it. Something else. You, you look different.

[Kramer starts eating a sandwich]

MICKEY: You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met you.

JOHNNY: I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. I'll find out.

[Kramer and Mickey look at each other. Mickey makes a pointing motion as if to reference the conversation with Johnny. Kramer shakes his head no]


[Back to Jerry with Fulton]

JERRY: ...so uh, she's just sitting there and a uh, Pachyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh, he uh, picks up the two pieces of...

[He wipes his brow]

JERRY: ...pizza and uh, the uh, and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling them.

[He does some juggling motions]

JERRY: He's juggling them, just throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her, down they go.

[Swallows and takes a breath]

JERRY: Well we all just lost it.

[Fulton is not laughing, stone faced]

JERRY: It was really, really funny.

[Phil Enters]

PHIL: Hey Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Phil how you doing?

PHIL: You look terrific.

JERRY: I got my health.

PHIL: Well, that's the most important thing. Hey how you doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane!

[Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry]

PHIL: How's he doing?

JERRY: He could use a couple laughs.


[At Jerry's Apartment]

[Jerry and Elaine]

ELAINE: You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.

[Buzzer]

JERRY: I told it. Yeah?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah.

[He hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine]

JERRY: Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.

ELAINE: Do I know him?

JERRY: No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.

ELAINE: If you were a woman would you go out with him?

JERRY: If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.

ELAINE: Yeah, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.

JERRY: Alright.

[George Enters]

GEORGE: This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, get this, to "Not to get involved with me."

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Yeah. That's what she told me.

ELAINE: Why?

GEORGE: Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.

ELAINE: Is she?

GEORGE: Of course.

ELAINE: So?

GEORGE: He doesn't have to tell her.

ELAINE: Maybe he likes her.

GEORGE: Oh no no no. He's deeply in love and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.

JERRY: So what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: Well I can't break up with her now.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Because he said I was going to.

ELAINE: So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?

GEORGE: Yes I am.

JERRY: Yeah, I could see that.

GEORGE: I don't see any way around it.

JERRY: No, me either.

GEORGE: What choice do I have?

JERRY: None.


[At the ABC studio locker room]

[Mickey walks in to discover his locker is open and that his lifts where in there]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry and Kramer]

JERRY: Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.

KRAMER: Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?

JERRY: Yes, I told him the Pachyderm story!

KRAMER: Maybe I ought to go over there.

JERRY: Towards what end?

KRAMER: I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.

[Someone knocks on the door]

[Jerry and Kramer walk over to it. Kramer opens it to reveal Mickey]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey Mick.

MICKEY: Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.

KRAMER: Yow!

[Mickey slams the door]

MICKEY: That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.

KRAMER: Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.

MICKEY: Yeah, well just keep out of my business you big ape.

[He pushes Kramer]

KRAMER: Who you calling big ape?

[He pushes Mickey back]

MICKEY: You!

[He grabs Kramer]

[Mickey and Kramer begin to struggle]

[Jerry pulls them apart]

JERRY: Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now.

[Kramer yells]

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: Behave yourselves.

MICKEY: I'm sorry Kramer.

KRAMER: No no, it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed out!

JERRY: Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?

MICKEY: Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars. The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.

KRAMER: What's he like huh?

MICKEY: He's a good kid.

KRAMER: Yeah?

JERRY: So what does he care if you put lifts in?

MICKEY: You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?


[In George's car outside Daphne's place]

DAPHNE: George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...

GEORGE: You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.

DAPHNE: Why not?

GEORGE: I, I really should go home. Yeah, actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow. We're uh, we're going to a father son picnic, just the two of us.

DAPHNE: I thought we were going to spend the day together.

GEORGE: Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got that, that game with foam paddles and the Velcro ball.

DAPHNE: Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?

GEORGE: Yes, oh yes very much.

DAPHNE: Maybe you don't want to move in.

GEORGE: No no, I do. You know it's just...

DAPHNE: Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.

[George is angry that she believes Al was right]

GEORGE: No, he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright, I'm canceling the father son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.


[Elaine and Phil in Phil's car outside Elaine's apartment]

ELAINE: So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot, he can barely hold them. I mean he's like trying to juggle...
 
[He does a juggling motion and begins laughing]

ELAINE: ...the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...

[Phil is laughing]

PHIL: I'm peeing in my pants.

ELAINE: They go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face.

[They both continue to laugh really hard]

ELAINE: And the whole place went crazy.

PHIL: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, what a story.

ELAINE: I know, I know, I was unbelievable.

[The laughter dies down]

PHIL: Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.

ELAINE: I know.

PHIL: Well this has been one hell of a night.

ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.

PHIL: You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh, well good night.

PHIL: Good night?

ELAINE: Well...

[She leans in to kiss Phil then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry sitting on a stool on the phone]

JERRY: Come on Adrian, give me another chance. I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act, no new material.

[Elaine enters]

JERRY: He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed.

[He waves hello to Elaine]

JERRY: Thank you, thanks for... you will not regret this. Okay, bye.

[He hangs up phone]

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: Hello.

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Come on. How was your date?

ELAINE: Oh, the date, the date.

JERRY: Yeah, how was it?

ELAINE: Interesting.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE: Oh yeah.

JERRY: Why what happened?

ELAINE: Let's see, how shall I put this?

JERRY: Just put it.

ELAINE: He took it out.

[Jerry is confused]

JERRY: He what?

ELAINE: He took...

[She blows on her glasses twice to clean them]

ELAINE: ...it out.

JERRY: He took what out?

ELAINE: It.

JERRY: He took it, out?

ELAINE: Yes siree bob.

JERRY: He couldn't.

ELAINE: He did.

JERRY: Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: You mean he just...

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: Are you sure?

ELAINE: Oh quite.

JERRY: There was no mistaking it?

[She looks straight at Jerry]

ELAINE: Jerry.

JERRY: So you were talking.

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

JERRY: You're having pleasant conversation.

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

JERRY: Then all of sudden.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: It.

ELAINE: It.

JERRY: Out.

ELAINE: Out.

JERRY: Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?

ELAINE: Oh it be. You got any other friends you want to set me up with?

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey. Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?

ELAINE: He took it out.

[Shocked, Kramer acts like he just got a cold shiver down his back]

KRAMER: Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's inhuman.


[At Monk's Cafe]

[Jerry and George sitting at the booth nearest to the door]

GEORGE: So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation and all of a sudden...

JERRY: It.

GEORGE: It.

JERRY: Out.

GEORGE: Out.

[Jerry shakes his head in agreement]

GEORGE: Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off.

[George looks at his watch]

GEORGE: Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne's gonna be here any minute.

JERRY: Alright I'm going.

GEORGE: You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.

JERRY: Well how long you are going to keep this up?

GEORGE: Hey, I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.

JERRY: You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set up a meet and greet.

GEORGE: I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.

JERRY: Yes I do.

GEORGE: What are you doing?

JERRY: I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.


[In Fulton's hospital room]

[Phil and Jerry are in the hall outside Fulton's Room]

PHIL: Ah, hey Jer.

JERRY: Oh, hey Phil.

PHIL: You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.

JERRY: Well, you showed her who you are.

[Phil turns to see a woman breast feeding her baby down the hallway]

PHIL: Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.

JERRY: Yeah, that's the last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.

PHIL: I'll see you.

JERRY: Yeah, take it easy.

[Phil leaves]

[Jerry enters Fulton's Room]

JERRY: Hey how you doing? Good to be here.


[At the ABC studios set]

KRAMER: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Alright, rock beats paper.

[Mickey smacks Kramer on the hand for losing]

KRAMER: I thought paper covered rock?

MICKEY: Nah, rock flies right through paper.

KRAMER: What beats rock?

MICKEY: Nothing beats rock.

KRAMER: Alright come on.

KRAMER: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.

KRAMER: Rock.

MICKEY: Rock.

KRAMER: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.

KRAMER: Rock.

MICKEY: Rock.

[Bob walks by]

MICKEY: Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? You see that look he gave me?

[He starts to get up to go after him]

[Kramer stops him]

KRAMER: Alright, come on.

KRAMER: Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY: Rock, paper, scissors match.

KRAMER: Rock.

MICKEY: Rock.

[Tammy walks up]

MICKEY: Hey Tammy.

TAMMY: Hello.

MICKEY: So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.

TAMMY: I don't think so.

MICKEY: Why not? What the hell are you talking about?

TAMMY: Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set.

MICKEY: Wait, wait.

[He goes to grab her arm]

TAMMY: Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.

MICKEY: Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid.

[Numerous little people begin to crowd around them]

MICKEY: The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. I would have lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing.

[He sees the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did. He points at Kramer] 
MICKEY: It's all his fault.

[Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about]

MICKEY: It was his idea.

TAMMY: Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.

[All the little people leave including Tammy along with Johnny]

[Mickey is in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny]

MICKEY: Ah!

[He turns and looks at Kramer]

MICKEY: Ah!

KRAMER: What?

[Mickey runs and tackles Kramer]

MICKEY: Ah!

KRAMER: Mickey!


[Back in Fulton's hospital room]

[Jerry is doing material]

JERRY: This guy's belching out vitamins.

[Fulton is dying of laughter]

FULTON: Stop.

JERRY: And this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?

[Fulton is still laughing]

FULTON: Stop.

JERRY: For crying out loud, he's Superman.

[Fulton stops laughing. Jerry's face is stunned]

JERRY: Fulton?

[He looks at him]

JERRY: Fulton?


[At Monk's Cafe]

[George and Daphne at the booth nearest to the door]

DAPHNE: George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days and that's what makes this all the more difficult.

GEORGE: Difficult?

DAPHNE: The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...

GEORGE: Oh, please don't.

DAPHNE: Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.

GEORGE: Pachyderm?

DAPHNE: Huh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza.
