[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: I had glasses when I was ten years old and anybody beat that? Did anyone get them younger than that?

[He hears someone say an age, turns]

JERRY: Seven? Two? Anybody born with glasses? Actually come out of the birth canal and go...

[He does the motion like he just took off some glasses]

JERRY: "That was a hell of a delivery, I'll tell you that. Can I clean these? 

[He motions like he is handing glasses to someone]

JERRY: Does anybody have one of those little cloths? I just, I was just born they, they're a little smudgy.


[At a yogurt shop]

[Elaine, George, and Jerry are sitting at a table eating Yogurt out of a cup]

ELAINE: Hmm!

GEORGE: Fantastic!

JERRY: I told you. How good is this?

GEORGE: Good.

JERRY: How good?

GEORGE: Very good.

JERRY: I know it.

ELAINE: They put real blueberries in this. And there's real blueberries. What kind did you get?

JERRY: Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans and put it in.

ELAINE: Let me test taste that.

[She tastes Jerry's yogurt]

JERRY: Huh? Huh?

ELAINE: Hmm! Rico!

JERRY: Suave! And it's non-fat!

GEORGE: You see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.

[She offers her yogurt to George]

ELAINE: You want to taste mine?

[George offers his]

GEORGE: Oh, you want to taste mine.

ELAINE: No, I don't.

GEORGE: Look, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.

ELAINE: Alright, let's just forget it.

JERRY: You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JERRY: He invested in it.

GEORGE: No kidding?

JERRY: Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so [Bleeped] ing good.

[Mary Edith and Matthew walk by]

MARYEDITH: Jerry!

JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.

ELAINE: Alright, we should get going. But I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?

GEORGE: Oh God, look who's here.

JERRY: Who is it?

GEORGE: This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.

JERRY: Oh?

LLOYD: Hey George!

GEORGE: Hey hey! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.

LLOYD: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

LLOYD: So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?

GEORGE: Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.

LLOYD: Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh?

[George nudges Jerry with his right arm]

LLOYD: Something wrong with your arm?

GEORGE: Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the uh, I, I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh, injured something and now it sort of moves involuntarily.

LLOYD: Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?

GEORGE: Oh, pretty good.

LLOYD: This place does some business, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, this is my first time here.

[He nudges Jerry again]

[Lloyd looks at Elaine]

LLOYD: Hey, she's a doll.

ELAINE: Hi!

GEORGE: Uh, Elaine, this is uh, Lloyd.

ELAINE: Hi!

LLOYD: Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.

[Elaine and Lloyd shake hands]

ELAINE: Nice to meet you too!

LLOYD: Well, I'm really sorry, I gotta run now.

[He sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out]

LLOYD: Well, take it easy, huh, George?

GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah.

[Jerry, George, and Elaine head toward the door to leave]

ELAINE: Ah boy, he is really cute!

GEORGE: He's a jerk.

[He nudges to his right but no one is there]

JERRY: He's gone, George.

GEORGE: Alright, alright.


[At Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: So, there were a lot of people there, huh?

JERRY: Oh man, that yogurt place, you're going to make a fortune.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: They're doing an incredible business.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.

JERRY: How did you know?

KRAMER: Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.

[The intercom buzzes]

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: Buzz me.

JERRY: Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.

KRAMER: Yeah, but did you tape it?

[Jerry pulls out a tape from his pocket]

JERRY: Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?

KRAMER: Yes!

JERRY: I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey!

KRAMER: Hey!

[Elaine has her thumb in her mouth pushing her teeth]

JERRY: What's the matter?

ELAINE: Oh, I was having lunch and I bit down on the fork.

JERRY: Boy, it's hard to believe with all that biting experience a person could still make a mistake like that.

[Kramer looks at Elaine and sort of falls backwards]

KRAMER: Yow!

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Well, you're getting heavy.

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, you look like you put on...

[He holds his hands out]

KRAMER: ...five...

[He holds his hands wider]

KRAMER: ...ten pounds.

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.

JERRY: Me?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Where's your bathroom scale?

[Jerry looks at her like "where do you think?" Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom]

ELAINE: Oh my God, I've gained seven pounds.

JERRY: I've gained eight.

KRAMER: I told you.

ELAINE: Oh my God! A couple, but seven pounds. How did I gain seven pounds?

JERRY: How did I gain eight?

ELAINE: I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.

JERRY: Me either. Wait a second, wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.

KRAMER: No no no, that's hundred percent non-fat.

JERRY: Well, how else could this have happened?

KRAMER: Well, maybe it's the Oreos.

ELAINE: I don't eat Oreos.

KRAMER: You don't eat Oreos?

[He acts out eating Oreos]

KRAMER: The way you break them open? You're...

[He does a bunch of licking motions]

KRAMER: ...practically having sex with them.

JERRY: What about me?

KRAMER: You? You're getting old.

JERRY: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.

KRAMER: Oh, guess again, tubby!

ELAINE: Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.

JERRY: There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.

ELAINE: Ah! I've got it.

KRAMER: What?

ELAINE: I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.

[Grabs Jerry, feels him noticing the eight pounds]

KRAMER: Hey, I'll tell you what chubs. If that yogurt has fat in it I will put myself on an all yogurt diet for a week.

JERRY: Well, let's start the insanity.

KRAMER: Giddy up!


[At the Costanza's House]

[Frank is in his chair. George is lying on the couch and Estelle is cleaning some items]

FRANK: Tommy Tune is a very good dancer.

[He hits George on the head with the TV guide]

FRANK: You ever see Tommy Tune dance?

GEORGE: No.

ESTELLE: I like tap dancing.

FRANK: Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.

ESTELLE: Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.

GEORGE: What's for supper?

[The door bell rings]

ESTELLE: Somebody's at the door.

[Estelle walks over to answer the door]

FRANK: Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.

ESTELLE: Lloyd?

LLOYD: Hello, Mrs. Costanza.

ESTELLE: Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.

[George slouches down on the couch in hopes to hide himself]

FRANK: Hey! Lloyd!

ESTELLE: What are you doing here?

[Frank and Lloyd shake]

LLOYD: Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".

ESTELLE: Georgie. Come here and say hello.

FRANK: How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.

LLOYD: That's right. Hey George.

GEORGE: Hey, Lloyd.

[He shakes hands with Lloyd]

LLOYD: How's it going?

LLOYD: I uh, ran into George yesterday in the city.

[George nudges Estelle]

ESTELLE: Ow!

[She hits George on the forehead]

ESTELLE: What's the matter with you?

LLOYD: So uh, how's the arm, huh?

GEORGE: Oh, it's good.

ESTELLE: What's the matter with your arm?

GEORGE: Nothing.

LLOYD: Oh, his arm moves like this.

[He does the nudging motion]

FRANK: Your arm moves like this?

[He does the nudging motion]

GEORGE: Yeah.

FRANK: I never seen your arm move like this.

ESTELLE: Me, either.

GEORGE: Well, it comes and goes.

FRANK: It's like some kind of a...

[He snaps his fingers]

FRANK: ...spasm.

LLOYD: Oh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists and he said he had the best.

[He hands George the Doctor's card]

LLOYD: So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.

ESTELLE: Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?

FRANK: You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?

ESTELLE: Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.

[George with his hands on his face acting like he is so excited the Mayor was discussing him]

GEORGE: You know, Lloyd, I, I've been to the doctor, there's really nothing they can do.

FRANK: Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?

GEORGE: Alright, alright! I'll go.

LLOYD: Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Elaine is on the phone]

ELAINE: Uh huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. Alright.

[She hangs up the phone] 
ELAINE: Okay, I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.

JERRY: And they said they can do it?

ELAINE: Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.

JERRY: Alright. Let's go down to the yogurt store and we'll get a specimen.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

[There's a knock on the door. Jerry answers it]

MARYEDITH: Well, I hope you're satisfied.

JERRY: What?

MARYEDITH: Every word out of my son's mouth now is [Beep, beep, beep] 
[Jerry half turns and puts his head down for a second]

MARYEDITH: You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my [Beep] ing cupcake?

JERRY: Gee, I'm really sorry.

MARYEDITH: He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?

JERRY: I'd be happy to.

MARYEDITH: Thank you.

JERRY: Ah Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh, yogurt at the yogurt place. Does that have any fat in it?

MARYEDITH: No [Beep] ing way!

[Jerry and Elaine look at each other]


[At the Costanza's House]

LLOYD: Well, it was very nice seeing you again.

ESTELLE: Oh, it was good seeing you.

LLOYD: Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?

GEORGE: Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.

ESTELLE: You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?

LLOYD: She is. She is. How about giving me her number?

GEORGE: Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.

ESTELLE: She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.

LLOYD: Oh, great.

[He nudges George on the chin]

LLOYD: Thanks a lot!

GEORGE: Yeah!

LLOYD: Bye bye.

ESTELLE: Bye!

[Lloyd leaves]

ESTELLE: Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?


[At the yogurt shop]

[Newman is seen sitting with a bunch of his coworkers]

NEWMAN: Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!

[Newman is laughing with a bunch of postal employees. Jerry and Elaine walk by him]

JERRY: Hello, Newman.

NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!

JOEL: Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?

JERRY: It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.

ELAINE: I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?

JOEL: That's right.

ELAINE: Because I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.

JOEL: Yeah, well, there is no fat.

NEWMAN: Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.


[In Jerry's car]

[Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer on the way to the lab]

ELAINE: Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!

JERRY: How's it doing?

ELAINE: Not so good.

KRAMER: Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.

JERRY: So what.

KRAMER: It changes the molecules.

JERRY: Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.

KRAMER: Hey, fatso! I got a ninety in biology.

JERRY: You call me fatso one more time, you're going to be walking back.


[At the lab]

ELAINE: Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.

LABTECHNICIAN: Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?

ELAINE: Uh, does it matter if it's melted?

LABTECHNICIAN: No!

[Elaine gives Kramer a look. He holds his hands up as if to say, "Whatever"]

LABTECHNICIAN: You know, this is going to take a couple of days.

[Kramer notices a female lab tech and goes over to her]

ELAINE: That's okay.

KRAMER: Hello, there.

[She turns to see Kramer standing behind her]

CHERYL: Hello.

KRAMER: Oh! Test tubes. Cool!

JERRY: What do you got there?

LABTECHNICIAN: Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it.

JERRY: Oh.

ELAINE: Okay, I'm done.

CHERYL: It was really nice meeting you.

KRAMER: Well, the pleasure's all mine.


[In Jerry's car]

JERRY: You can't take that chemist out.

KRAMER: Why not?

JERRY: Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.

KRAMER: I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.

JERRY: Well, I think the whole thing stinks.

ELAINE: It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.

JERRY: That's enough.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: With the smelling.


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Jerry is pouring Cheerios into a scale]

GEORGE: So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkin's doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.

JERRY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.

JERRY: Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? [Moves his arm] He's gonna think you're a mental patient.

GEORGE: I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me.

[He moves his arm]

GEORGE: My whole life is a lie.

[Elaine enters]

ELAINE: Hey!

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: So, guess who called me.

GEORGE: Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?

ELAINE: We're going out tomorrow night.

GEORGE: Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk and it's been moving involuntarily ever since.

ELAINE: I can't say that.

GEORGE: Why not?

ELAINE: What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?

GEORGE: So, you're taking his side?

ELAINE: No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.

GEORGE: Already you're marrying this guy?

ELAINE: You never know.

GEORGE: Alright, believe me, you're not going to marry him.

ELAINE: Alright, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this?

[She moves her arm] 
ELAINE: Even you can't keep that up.

JERRY: No, I believe he can.

[There’s a knock at the door. Jerry answers it]

MARYEDITH: Hi!

JERRY: Hi!

MARYEDITH: You know Jerry.

MATTHEW: Of course, he's the funny [Beep].

[Elaine and George peer out from the refrigerator]

MARYEDITH: See!

JERRY: Listen, Matthew, I, I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.

[Elaine and George turn and look at Jerry from behind the counter]

MATTHEW: You did it.

JERRY: That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up.

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Excuse me one second.

[Jerry looks toward Elaine and George who give him the "Yeah sure" look]

ELAINE: You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, big advisor.

ELAINE: He tells him which soap to use.

[Matthew is seen pulling the tape out of Jerry's recording of his new material mentioned earlier in the show. Jerry sitting by the window on the phone sees this and quickly moves towards Matthew]

JERRY: What the [Beep] are you doing? You little piece of [Beep]

[Elaine and George are shocked. George throws stuff into the air and Elaine pulls a large amount of paper towels off a roll]


[At the lab]

CHERYL: Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.

KRAMER: Where's the lights. Whoa!

CHERYL: How about this?

[Cheryl lights a Bunsen burner]

KRAMER: Yeah! Bunsen burner.

[He runs his fingers through the flame]

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah.

CHERYL: Oh.

KRAMER: Yeah.

CHERYL: Ha ha.

KRAMER: You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.

CHERYL: It's delicious.

KRAMER: I hear you.

CHERYL: Non-fat?

KRAMER: Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?

CHERYL: No.

KRAMER: Well, this is in case there's a tie!

[Kramer kisses Cheryl. Cheryl kicks the lab chair toward a table which holds the yogurt specimen in a test tube which is right above the Giuliani blood. The yogurt test tube is then poured into the Giuliani blood]


[At the yogurt shop]

ELAINE: Well, as far as I know he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a spasm. So anyway, you're a, you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?

LLOYD: Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.

ELAINE: Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.

LLOYD: Name tags, hmm?

ELAINE: Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.

LLOYD: Maybe I'll mention that to him.

ELAINE: Really? Wow.

LLOYD: You sure you don't want any yogurt?

ELAINE: No, I'm watching my weight.

LLOYD: Well, it's non-fat.

ELAINE: Yeah, so they say.

LLOYD: Well I'm done, should we go?

ELAINE: Yeah. Okay.

[They walk out and when Lloyd grabs Elaine he notices she is a little bit pudgy]


[At Jerry's apartment]

[Elaine has her head down on the counter. Jerry is measuring some more food]

ELAINE: Three days and he hasn't called me and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.

JERRY: He said that?

ELAINE: No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"

[Kramer enters whistling]

KRAMER: Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?

JERRY: No, but I expect to hear anytime.

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

JERRY: Why do you say that?

KRAMER: No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?

ELAINE: No. What about him?

KRAMER: You didn't hear?

ELAINE: Un huh.

KRAMER: He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.

[Elaine is silently full of joy]

JERRY: Name tags?

KRAMER: Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.

JERRY: Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"

KRAMER: He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags!

[The phone rings]

JERRY: Hello? Yes. Uh huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye bye.

[He hangs up the phone]

JERRY: Well, the yogurt verdict is in.

[Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out]

JERRY: Fat!

KRAMER: Yow!


[At the doctor's office]

[George is in the office with the doctor]

GEORGE: The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this.

[He moves his arm slowly]

GEORGE: I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise.

[His arm moves] 
GEORGE: Oh.

DOCTOR: Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.

GEORGE: Please, doctor.

DOCTOR: I've examined you.

GEORGE: Yes.

DOCTOR: I've looked at your X-rays.

GEORGE: Uh huh.

DOCTOR: And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.

GEORGE: Hmm. Really? Nothing?

DOCTOR: Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.

GEORGE: Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?

DOCTOR: No, not really.

GEORGE: How so?

DOCTOR: May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?

GEORGE: Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?

DOCTOR: I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good bye.

GEORGE: Now see here, doctor.

DOCTOR: I said, good bye.

GEORGE: Fine.

[He hits his arm on the desk]

GEORGE: Ow!


[At Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE: Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.

JERRY: Look Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey look, wait a second.

[He looks at the TV]

JERRY: Kramer, turn that up.

KRAMER: Huh, Okay.

NEWSCASTER: Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping three seventy-five. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.

GIULIANI: It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.

JERRY: Non-fat yogurt? Oh my God. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.

[Elaine points to Kramer] 

ELAINE: Now look what you've done.

JERRY: Well, we've got to do something.

[He grabs his phone]

JERRY: I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.


[At the Costanza's house]

[Frank is sitting on his chair. Estelle is on the couch. George is standing in between them]

GEORGE: Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.

FRANK: I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?"

[George's arm moves and hits the lamp]

FRANK: Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.

GEORGE: I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An a...

ESTELLE: Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.

GIULIANI: My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt.


[At the yogurt shop]

[Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer sitting at a table in the Yogurt Shop]

JERRY: The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.

GEORGE: Phew!

ELAINE: Oh, it stinks.

KRAMER: Mine too. I got one more day.

JERRY: I can't eat this.

NEWMAN: Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.

JERRY: It had fat in it, it's not good for you.

NEWMAN: I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.

ELAINE: Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this.

[She reads from the newspaper]

ELAINE: Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be one hundred and fifty points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.

JERRY: So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.

ELAINE: I wonder what actually happened in that lab.

KRAMER: Yeah, me, too.

NEWMAN: I can't eat this.

[Newman exits in disgust along with another customer. Matthew and his mom come over. He hits Jerry to get his attention]

MATTHEW: Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat [Beep]


[At the Comedy Club]

JERRY: There's nothing more fun than cursing when you're a kid. I mean it's like getting the keys to the car isn't it? You're doing something you're not supposed to do and that's all you want. And there's nothing less fun than when you're an adult and having to use those wholesome curses.

[With a lot of emphasis]

JERRY: "Fudge"

[More emphasis]

JERRY: "Sugar" "Con-sarnit" What the hell is "con-sarnit" anyway? I mean you stub your toe and you say con-sarnit you might as well say, "Yippee" But if you've ever been to a foreign country the first thing you learn are the curse words, right? You travel halfway around the world to experience some centuries old exotic civilization, the first thing you ask is, "How do they say doodie here?"
