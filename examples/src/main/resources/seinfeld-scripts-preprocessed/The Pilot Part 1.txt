

JERRY: To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have A.A. type meetings for these people? They'll go, "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream colored couch." According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.




KRAMER: Why, why can't I play Kramer?

JERRY: Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!

KRAMER: Neither are you.

JERRY: I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act? Come on, you say something, I'll pretend its funny, come on.

JERRY: My grandmother's in the hospital.



KRAMER: Your grandmother's in the hospital!

JERRY: This is real believable.

KRAMER: What, what you didn't think I was really laughing?

JERRY: It stinks.

KRAMER: Alright, let me see you do it.

JERRY: Say something funny.

KRAMER: Alright, uh, I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.



KRAMER: Mine was better than that! Come on look.





GEORGE: Why are two pretending to be laughing?

JERRY: We're acting.



GEORGE: Oh, real good.



GEORGE: Any word from NBC?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.

KRAMER: Well at least let me audition.

JERRY: He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.

KRAMER: Yeah!

GEORGE: Out of the question.

KRAMER: Oh!

GEORGE: How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russell? What's he doing?






RUSSELL: I really appreciate you coming.

ELAINE: Oh, that's okay. I uh, I don't have much time though. So...

RUSSELL: Alright, well first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just, it's just...



RUSSELL: I don't understand, we went out once and...

ELAINE: Yeah that was two months ago.



RUSSELL: Yes I know. I just, I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that, that day in that restaurant when we met.



ELAINE: Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want.



RUSSELL: But I want you.

ELAINE: Oh I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels out on the table? Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know who eats these cheesy things.

RUSSELL: Is it something I said... or did?

ELAINE: Um, look Russell, you're a very sweet guy. But um, I got to be honest with you. I don't like television and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in uh, I don't know, Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television. I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.

RUSSELL: Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very, very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young uh, comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, yeah, I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.

RUSSELL: Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.

ELAINE: Really? What is it about?

RUSSELL: Well, really, really it's very unusual. It's about nothing.

ELAINE: What do you mean it's about nothing?

RUSSELL: For example, what, what did you do today?

ELAINE: Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.

RUSSELL: There's a show, that's a show.

ELAINE: Russell, see, I'm, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work.



ELAINE: So...

RUSSELL: Elaine, uh, When are we, when are we gonna see each other again.

ELAINE: I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry okay? Bye bye.








JERRY: Hello? Yeah he's here. Hey! It's for you.

KRAMER: Oh yeah?

GEORGE: He's getting phone calls here now?



KRAMER: Hello.

JERRY: Again with the sweat pants?

GEORGE: What? I'm comfortable.

JERRY: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world, "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."



KRAMER: Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back.



JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: Uh, itï¿½s NBC.

JERRY: NBC!? Give me the phone!

KRAMER: I'm in the middle of a conversation here.

JERRY: Get off the phone!

KRAMER: Look, I'll call you back. Yeah.



JERRY: You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?

KRAMER: Russell Dalrimple's secretary.

JERRY: Alright. Now you're doing something to help me.



JERRY: Hello? Yeah, it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh huh. Okay. Great, thanks a lot.



JERRY: Casting tomorrow at NBC four o'clock. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful! 






GEORGE: What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?

DANA: That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.

DANA: I thought you didn't believe in God?

GEORGE: I do for the bad things.

DANA: Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What, What is that on your lip?

GEORGE: What?

DANA: It's like a discoloration. It's white.



GEORGE: Yes. Yes, it's white. Why is that white?

DANA: You'd better get that checked out.

GEORGE: Better get that checked out?

DANA: I would.

GEORGE: What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?

DANA: I'm trying to help you.

GEORGE: What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make them feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor.



DANA: I think you'd better go.

GEORGE: Oh I'm going baby! I'm going!






JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: Right here.



JERRY: Get out of here, it's nothing.

GEORGE: Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?

CABBIE: Yeah, it's like a discoloration.

GEORGE: Oh my God.

CABBIE: Yeah, it's all white.

GEORGE: It's all white Jerry! It's all white!

JERRY: Would you stop?

CABBIE: I would get that checked out if I were you.

GEORGE: Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.

JERRY: If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.

GEORGE: Catch what in time?

JERRY: Whatever it is.

GEORGE: You think it's something?



CABBIE: Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car!



JERRY: You know these squeegee... oh my God! It's crazy Joe Davola.





DAVOLA: Good luck on the pilot Jerry.








STU: Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.

GEORGE: What do you think it is?

JAY: It's like a... white discoloration.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay guys, are we ready to start?

JERRY: Yeah, where's Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.



STU: Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning. I said hello to him. He walked right past me.

JAY: He must be worried about the fall schedule.

STU: Ah, it's a real bear.

GEORGE: Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?

STU: Yeah. Right.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George.



MARK: Hey, how you doing?

GEORGE: Hey Mark, how are you?



JERRY: They've gotta be kidding.



GEORGE: This guy's perfect.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.

MARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?



CASTINGDIRECTOR: No, why?

MARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say, "Vandelay Industries".

CASTINGDIRECTOR: I'm Vandelay Industries?

MARK: Right.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: What is that?

MARK: You're in latex.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: What do I do with latex?

MARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Michael Barth. Another George.



STU: Hi Michael.

JAY: How you doing?

JERRY: Everything alright?

MICHAELBARTH: I just came from the podiatrist. Yeah I got something on my foot, I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: Any questions?

MICHAELBARTH: Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?

GEORGE: No, not a loser!

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Uh, let's start with the second scene. You have it here?

MICHAELBARTH: Yeah.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay.

MICHAELBARTH: A man gave me a uh, massage.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: So?

MICHAELBARTH: Um, Uh, he uh, he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was uh...

CASTINGDIRECTOR: He was what?

MICHAELBARTH: Well he was you know... he was touching and rubbing.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: That's a massage.

MICHAELBARTH: I think it moved.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Melissa Shannon.

MELISSA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GEORGE: How you doing.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Melissa is reading for Elaine.

MELISSA: It's like a bald convention out there!



MELISSA: Sorry. I uh, made a faux pas.

JERRY: No you didn't. He knows he's bald.

MELISSA: So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that?



CASTINGDIRECTOR: Okay. Shall we start?



JERRY: Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.

MELISSA: Oh, great.



JERRY: Alright, want to start?

MELISSA: Yeah.

JERRY: Okay.

MELISSA: Ahem. What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

MELISSA: That look you just gave me?

JERRY: I gave a look?

MELISSA: Yes.

GEORGE: Thank you! Thank you very much.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: Let's see some more Kramers.




GEORGE: Hi.

JERRY: How you doing?

TOM: How you doing?

JERRY: Good.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: What is this about?

TOM: Levels.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: Levels?

TOM: Yeah. Get rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted...



TOM: ...with pillows.



TOM: Like Ancient Egypt.

CASTINGDIRECTOR: I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?

TOM: Oh... I'll be comfortable.



GEORGE: Very nice

JERRY: Very good

GEORGE: Very nice Tom, that was terrific.

TOM: May I?



GEORGE: Sure. Thank you for coming in.



JERRY: It was a wonderful reading.

GEORGE: Yeah. Really.

TOM: Well, bye.

GEORGE: Take care. Take it easy.



STU: Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.

JERRY: Yeah, I liked him.

GEORGE: What happened to the raisins?

JAY: Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!

GEORGE: Did he just steal the raisins?

STU: You think he stole them?



CASTINGDIRECTOR: This is Martin Van Nostrand.

JERRY: What are you doing here?

CASTINGDIRECTOR: You two know each other?

STU: Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.

KRAMER: That's true.



KRAMER: I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in.



KRAMER: Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?

STU: I think if you go down the hall it's on the right at the very end.

KRAMER: Yeah. Be right back.











ELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?

JERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very talented young actress.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Who is it?

JERRY: She's an Eskimo, actually.

ELAINE: Oh my God.

JERRY: She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.

ELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?

JERRY: No, he didn't show up.

ELAINE: You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?

JERRY: No. No you're not.

ELAINE: Why do I keep setting you up?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: Could we get a little more?



ELAINE: You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is really slow.

JERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?

ELAINE: Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.

JERRY: Besides that. Look at the waitresses.

ELAINE: Yeah?



JERRY: What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?

ELAINE: Ah... ha.

JERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?

ELAINE: Yes, I would say.

JERRY: What's going on here? How is that possible?

ELAINE: Do you think it's a coincidence?

JERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.



ELAINE: Hi. Excuse me. Um, who does all of the hiring waitresses here?

WAITRESSSAMANTHA: He does.



WAITRESSSAMANTHA: In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone.



ELAINE: You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?

JERRY: Hey that's life. Good looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.




GEORGE: You see, its right here. It's all white.

DOCTORBRUCE: Oh yeah. Yeah. Huh, I've never seen this before.

GEORGE: You've never seen this before?

DOCTORBRUCE: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that.



GEORGE: A what?

DOCTORBRUCE: A biopsy.

GEORGE: A biopsy?

DOCTORBRUCE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?

DOCTORBRUCE: Well I don't know what it is.

 


GEORGE: He took a biopsy, Jerry, a biopsy!

JERRY: What did he say?

GEORGE: He said he didn't know what it was.

JERRY: Alright, so?

GEORGE: When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get out of here". That's what I wanted to hear, "Cancer? Get out of here?"

JERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get out of here" kind of personality.

GEORGE: How could you be a doctor and not say "get out of here"? It should be part of the training at medical school. "Cancer? Get out of here! Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"



GEORGE: I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this.

JERRY: Can't you at least die with a little dignity?

GEORGE: No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?



JERRY: Hey. What happened to you yesterday?

KRAMER: I got mugged.

GEORGE: You got mugged?

JERRY: Mugged?

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.

JERRY: Well why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?

KRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerry. I was really percolating. So I decided to run home, you know, through the park and then these two guys they stopped me.



JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.

JERRY: What is it?

KRAMER: Well, I uh, I waited so long I... I missed my chance.

JERRY: You didn't go?

KRAMER: No. And now I can't get it back.



JERRY: The last thing to do is just not think about it.

KRAMER: How could you not think about it?



ELAINE: Hey.



ELAINE: What's the matter with him?

JERRY: He's a little backed up.

ELAINE: Oh.



GEORGE: Elaine.

ELAINE: So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.

JERRY: Oh, the sisters.



GEORGE: Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.

ELAINE: So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.

GEORGE: Apply for a job? What for?

ELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory.



GEORGE: It's a coincidence.

JERRY: This is what you gonna wear?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You're not gonna get the job.

ELAINE: Exactly.



JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? Alright. Uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye.



ELAINE: Who was that?

JERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.

ELAINE: Oh, what about the dogs?

JERRY: They're having sex in the hotel room.






SANDI: So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.

JERRY: Yes.

SANDI: And she's really your ex-girlfriend?

JERRY: Uh huh, yeah.

SANDI: I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.

JERRY: Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, ban Lon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.

SANDI: How would she eat a hamburger?

JERRY: With her hands.

SANDI: What about pasta?

JERRY: Also with her hands.

SANDI: Seriously, I want to experience everything she's experienced.

JERRY: Everything?

SANDI: Everything.

JERRY: Alright she cuts her pasta with a knife.

SANDI: That's good. What's her favorite movie?

JERRY: Shaft.

SANDI: You got to get me a picture. What about sex?

JERRY: She likes talking during sex.

SANDI: Oh, dirty talking?

JERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi...



SANDI: Elaine.

JERRY: What?

SANDI: Call me Elaine.

JERRY: Alright. Elaine.

SANDI: How does Elaine kiss?

JERRY: Well...

SANDI: Does she kiss... like this?



JERRY: Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like...

SANDI: Like this?



JERRY: I think you got it.






KRAMER: Now, I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this, look.



KRAMER: Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down.



KRAMER: Bran flakes, one hundred percent, I got a big problem.

TOM: I'll have a hamburger. That's it.

KRAMER: Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.

TOM: This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.

KRAMER: You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.

TOM: I'm Kramer.

KRAMER: Whoa, I'm Kramer.



MRVISAKI: What can I do for you? Would you like a table?

ELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.



MRVISAKI: Have you ever waited on tables before.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I've been a professional waitress for the last ten years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.

MRVISAKI: I don't think I need anyone else right now.



ELAINE: You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital T.



MRVISAKI: What? What did I do?




ELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

FREDGANT: Who's Russ Meyer?

ELAINE: Oh, um, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the seventies with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.

FREDGANT: Anyway, go on.

ELAINE: Um, well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses and I went in to apply for the job. And he looked me up and down and he rejected me.

FREDGANT: Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.

PAUL: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

FREDGANT: Paul, the woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large breasted women.

PAUL: Really?
