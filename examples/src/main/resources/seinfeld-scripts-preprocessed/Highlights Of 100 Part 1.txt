



JERRY: Oh, hi. A hundred episodes, that's a lot. In the course of which George, Elaine, Kramer and I have had many experiences both positive and negative. Well mostly negative. There have been some relationships that haven't worked out ambitions that were unfulfilled, hopes dashed, some property damage, hurt feelings and I know one guy got deported, physical injury and... alright maybe even a death or two. But we've persevered because we're people... real TV people, and for thirty minutes a week...



JERRY: ...that's pretty important to us. So if you're joining us late...



JERRY: ...here's some highlights from what's happened so far.








GEORGE: Why don't they have salsa on the table? 

JERRY: What do you need salsa for? 

GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America. 

JERRY: Do you know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have any salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?" 

GEORGE: You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. "I wanted seltzer, not salsa." 

JERRY: "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltzer after the salsa!" 

GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show. 

JERRY: What? 

GEORGE: This. Just talking. 

JERRY: Yeah, right. 

GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea. 

JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about? 

GEORGE: It's about nothing.






KRAMER:  What's that red dot on your sweater?






KRAMER: Didn't we come in over there?

JERRY: I, I thought we came in over there.






KRAMER: I'm out! 



ELAINE: What?! 

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out, I'm out of the contest.




JERRY: No story?

GEORGE: No, forget the story.

JERRY: You got to have a story.

GEORGE: Who says you got to have a story?











JERRY: Four. Seinfeld.

BRUCE: Four. Oh, be five, ten minutes.




JERRY: Do you smell something? 

ELAINE: Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of course I smell something. 

JERRY: What is it? 

ELAINE: I think it's B O!




JERRY: And who's on the show? Who are the characters? 

GEORGE: I could be a character. 

JERRY: You? 

GEORGE: Yeah. You base a character on me.




MRLIPPMAN: It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct? 

GEORGE: Who said that? 

MRLIPPMAN: She did. 

GEORGE: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon.




JERRY: And who else is on the show? 

GEORGE: Elaine could be a character.




WOMANATPARTY: I wonder what happened to my fiancee? I know he's here somewhere. I have lost my fiancee the poor baby.

ELAINE: Maybe the dingo ate your baby. 

WOMANATPARTY: What? 

ELAINE: The dingo ate your baby!




GEORGE: Kramer.

JERRY: Now he's a character.




KRAMER: The bus is out of control! So I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm driving the bus. 

GEORGE: You're Batman. 

KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts choking me! So I'm fighting him off with one hand and I kept driving the bus with the other, you know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know at the next stop. 

JERRY: You kept making all the stops? 

KRAMER: Well, people kept ringing the bell!




JERRY: So everybody I know is a character on the show.

GEORGE: Right.






MORTY: My wallets gone! My wallets gone!






UNCLELEO: Jerry!

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

UNCLELEO: Hello!






HELEN: How could you? 

JERRY: How could I what? 

HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?




FRANK: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds. You know about the uh, cup sizes and all? They have different cups. 

GEORGE: Yeah I, I know about the cups. 


FRANK: You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.




ESTELLE: I go out for a quart of milk, I come home and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! 




NEWMAN: I'm a United States postal worker. 

GEORGE: Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody? 

NEWMAN: Sometimes. 

JERRY: Why is that? 

NEWMAN: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's Publisher's Clearing House day!!! 

JERRY: Alright! Alright!




JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing. 

GEORGE: We go into NBC. 

JERRY: "We"? Since when are you a writer? 

GEORGE: Writer. We're talking about a sit-com. 

JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC? 

GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here. 

JERRY: What do we got? 

GEORGE: An idea. 

JERRY: What idea? 

GEORGE: An idea for the show. 

JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is! 

GEORGE: It's about nothing! 

JERRY: Right. 

GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.




ELAINE: Come on, let's go do something. I don't want to just sit around here.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Want to go get something to eat?

JERRY: Where do you want to go?

ELAINE: I don't care, I'm not hungry.

JERRY: We could go to one of those uh, cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.

ELAINE: What are we gonna do there? Talk?

JERRY: We could talk.

ELAINE: I'll go if I don't have to talk.

JERRY: We'll just sit there.




JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space. 

JERRY: Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it? 

JACK: Oh it was a gift. 

JERRY: Because sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works. 

JACK: Take the pen. 

JERRY: Oh no. 

JACK: Go ahead. 

JERRY: I couldn't 

JACK: Come on, take the pen! 

JERRY: I can't take it. 

JACK: Do me a personal favor! 

JERRY: No, I'm not... 

JACK: Take the pen! 

JERRY: I cannot take it! 

JACK: Take the pen! 

JERRY: Are you sure? 

JACK: Positive! Take the pen! 

JERRY: Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy! 

HELEN: Jack, what are you doing? 

JACK: Stop it! 

DORIS: Jack, we should go.






JERRY: This? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: I agreed to wear this?! 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY: But, when did I do that? 

KRAMER: When we went to dinner the other night. 

JERRY: What are you, crazy?! 

KRAMER: What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom? 

JERRY: I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding! 

KRAMER: There you go. 

JERRY: Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV and I said "Yes"? 

KRAMER: Yes, yes! You said it! 

JERRY: But I, I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her! 



KRAMER: Well, she asked you. 

JERRY: I, I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous! 

KRAMER: Well you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already making them. 

JERRY: They're making these? 

KRAMER: Yes, yes. This pirate! trend that she's come up with Jerry. This, this is gonna be the new look for the nineties. You're gonna be the first pirate! 

JERRY: But, I don't want to be a pirate!




JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation? 

RENTALCARAGENT: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars. 

JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation. 

RENTALCARAGENT: I know why we have reservations. 

JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.




GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word.



GEORGE: "Nothing." 

RUSSELL: Nothing? 

GEORGE: Nothing. 

RUSSELL: What does that mean?

GEORGE: What did you do today? 

RUSSELL: I got up and came to work. 

GEORGE: There's a show. That's a show. 

RUSSELL: How is that a show? 

JERRY: Well uh, maybe, maybe something happens on the way to work. 

GEORGE: No no no, nothing happens. 

JERRY: Well, something happens. 

RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it? 

GEORGE: Because it's on TV. 

RUSSELL: Not yet.







JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking. 

GEORGE: What about the body, what kind of body? 

JERRY: Good body, nice body. 

GEORGE: How nice? 

JERRY: Nice. 

GEORGE: Just nice? 

JERRY: Pretty nice. 

GEORGE: Really good? 

JERRY: Really very nice and good. 

GEORGE: What about personality? 

JERRY: Good personality. Funny. Bright. 

GEORGE: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me. 

JERRY: How could she be smarter than you?




ELAINE: No no no, he's a really really funny guy. 

CYNTHIA: What does he look like? 

ELAINE: Pardon? 

CYNTHIA: What does he look like? 

ELAINE: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky. 

CYNTHIA: He's fat? Is that what you're saying, that he's fat? 

ELAINE: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair. 

CYNTHIA: He's bald? 

ELAINE: No! No no no, he's not bald. He's balding. 

CYNTHIA: So he will be bald. 

ELAINE: Yup.






GEORGE: Thick lustrous hair is very important to me. 

JERRY: "Thick lustrous hair is very important to me", is that what you said? 

GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. 

JERRY: Just clarifying. 



GEORGE: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out? 

JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out? 

GEORGE: I'd like to be able to get it out. 

JERRY: I think you'll get it out. 

GEORGE: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek. 

JERRY: She's got a fine cheek. 

GEORGE: Is there a pinkish hue? 

JERRY: A pinkish hue? 

GEORGE: Yes, a rosy glow. 

JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows. 

GEORGE: Who cares about eyebrows?






KRAMER: Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society.






ELAINE: You're gonna miss the plane! It's nine fifteen! 

EDDIE: Nine fifteen? 

ELAINE: Yes! Nine fifteen! 

EDDIE: We'll never make it. I'll leave tomorrow. 

ELAINE: Tomorrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!



ELAINE: You get dressed! Get dressed!




KRAMER: How could I be with someone like you? I couldn't respect myself. 




EDDIE: What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomorrow or the next day. 

ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now! 

EDDIE: I'll never make it. 

ELAINE: Don't say that! 

EDDIE: But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane. 

ELAINE: Shut up and pack!




KRAMER: I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love you!




GWEN: It's not you, it's me. 

GEORGE: You're giving me the "It's not you, it's me" 1routine? I invented the "It's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me. 

GWEN: Alright, George, it's you. 

GEORGE: You're damn right it's me.






KEITH: Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.

ELAINE: Well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.

KEITH: The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.

ELAINE: Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in.




MARLENE: I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night. 

JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night? 

MARLENE: I saw your act. 

JERRY: My act? What does that have to do with anything? 

MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff. 

JERRY: I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it? 

MARLENE: I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do. 

JERRY: You're a cashier!




DELORES: You don't know my name, do you? 

JERRY: Yes I do. 

DELORES: What is it? 

JERRY: It, it rhymes with a female body part. 

DELORES: What is it? 

JERRY: Mulva... 






SANDRA: Oh, I think you're really sick. 

JERRY: I'm not sick. You, you said much sicker things than me. 

SANDRA: I'm leaving.






JERRY: So, where were we?

SIDRA: I was just leaving.



JERRY: Right, you were leaving.

SIDRA: I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.

JERRY: That was an accident!

SIDRA: I think you're both mentally ill.



SIDRA: And by the way... they're real and they're spectacular.








JERRY: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? 

ELAINE: I know. 

JERRY: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated. 

ELAINE: It's almost stupid if we didn't. 

JERRY: It's moronic. 

ELAINE: Absurd! 

JERRY: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise. 

ELAINE: We, there are always a few. 

JERRY: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad. 

ELAINE: Devastating. 

JERRY: Because this...



JERRY: ...is very good. 



ELAINE: And that would be good.

JERRY: That would be good too. The idea is to combine the this...



JERRY: ...and the that.



JERRY: But this...



JERRY: ...cannot be disturbed. 

ELAINE: Yeah, we just wanna take this...



ELAINE: ...and add that.



JERRY: But of course we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something. 

ELAINE: Huh. 

JERRY: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa. 

ELAINE: Right. 

JERRY: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call. 

ELAINE: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No calls the day after that.



JERRY: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule. 

ELAINE: Alright, sir. 

JERRY: Now here's another little rule.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that. 

ELAINE: Okay, okay. Rule numer two, spending the night is optional. 

JERRY: Well now we're getting somewhere.



JERRY: I slept with Elaine last night. 

GEORGE: Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major. 

JERRY: I thought you'd like that. 

GEORGE: Oh, this is huge! 

JERRY: I know. 

GEORGE: Alright, okay. Let's go, details. 

JERRY: No, I can't do details. 

GEORGE: You what? 

JERRY: I can't give details. 

GEORGE: No details? 

JERRY: I'm not in the mood. 

GEORGE: You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!







GEORGE: I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer, "Vandelay Industries".

JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And what is that?

GEORGE: You're in latex

JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?

GEORGE: I don't know, you manufacture it.

ELAINE: Right here in this little apartment?

JERRY: And what do I say about you?

GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.

JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: I don't think so.




KRAMER: Man, I'm telling you. This pizza idea is really going to happen.

GEORGE: This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?

KRAMER: Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it up in the air and then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese and then, you slide it into the oven.

GEORGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.

KRAMER: It's all supervised.

GEORGE: Oh, well.




MRLIPPMAN: Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him. 

ELAINE: Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was had it been published under it's original title: "War, What Is It Good For?"

MRLIPPMAN: What?

ELAINE: Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress who insisted that he call it...

MRLIPPMAN: Elaine...

ELAINE: "War and Peace."

MRLIPPMAN: Elaine...

ELAINE: "War, What Is It Good For." Absolutely nothing. Huh!




JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building? 

GEORGE: Ah, you came to see me. I work in the building. 

JERRY: What do you do? 

GEORGE: I'm an architect. 

JERRY: You're an architect? 

GEORGE: I'm not? 

JERRY: I don't see architecture coming from you.






LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days and we'll let you know. 

ELAINE: I have no chance, do I? 

LANDIS: No.






GEORGE: You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect.




LOIS: What do you do? 

GEORGE: I'm an architect. 

LOIS: Have you designed any buildings in New York? 

GEORGE: Have you seen uh, the new addition to the Guggenheim? 

LOIS: You did that? 

GEORGE: Yep. And it didn't take very long either.






KRAMER: You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table. 



KATHIELEE: Is that fabulous? 

REGIS: Look at this!






KRAMER: Hello? What delay industries? 

ELAINE: No no... 



GEORGE: Vandelay! Say Vandelay! 

KRAMER: Nah, you're way way way off. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment. 



GEORGE: Vandelay! Say Vandelay!



GEORGE: Vandelay Industries! 

KRAMER: No problem. No problem.



KRAMER: How did you know who that was? 



JERRY: And you want to be my latex salesman.




GEORGE: Look, why don't you two just go to the movies by yourself. I'm not in the mood. 

ELAINE: Me either. I'm going to Sky Burger. 

JERRY: So, you're not going? 

ELAINE: You don't need us. 

JERRY: I can't go to a bad movie by myself. What am I, gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers? I guess I'll just go to my uncle's. 

GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving? 

ELAINE: What for? Let's just get out of here! 



BRUCE: Seinfeld, four.
