

GEORGE: You know if we are gonna see this movie we gotta get moving.



ELAINE: Let's Roll.



KRAMER: Come on people, previews. Snell! Snell!



JERRY: Oh, hello. Nine years, seems like a long time doesn't it? It is and we've packed a lot in the four of us. It seems like every week a whole new set of problems would just crop up out of nowhere... except for summer where nothing seemed to happen for months at a time. Anyway the point is over the last nine years...



GEORGE: Jerry were gonna miss the movie!

JERRY: I'm coming!

KRAMER: Previews Jerry!

JERRY: Just go already! Over the last nine years we've had a lot experiences. And I'll tell you, when you stop and add them all up. That's what you realize. Watch this.



ELAINE: Jerry?!



JERRY: Shut up!!











































































































































GEORGE: What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.



JERRY: Ah.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: What is this? What are we doing? What in God's name are we doing?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Our lives! What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.

GEORGE: No, we're not. We're not men.

JERRY: We're pathetic, you know that?

GEORGE: Yeah, like I don't know that I'm pathetic.






RACHEL: Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry.





GEORGE: I was in the pool! I was in the pool!






GEORGE: Yeah! You're right. You're probably right. 

SUSAN: What are you doing? 



SUSAN: Since when do you smoke? 

GEORGE: I've always smoked. 

SUSAN: I've never seen you smoke. 

GEORGE: Oh yeah, well, big smoker. I...



GEORGE: ...gave it up for a while but it was too tough. You know, I got no will power. 

SUSAN: I don't like this one bit. 

GEORGE: Well...



GEORGE: I can't stop now.



GEORGE: I'm addicted, they got a hold on me.

SUSAN: Well you are gonna have to quit.  

GEORGE: Oh my god. 






GEORGE: That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering 

JERRY: Are you sensing anything right now?








MRSENRIGHT: Oh... 



GEORGE: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! 






KRAMER: Do you have a woman? 

GEORGE: No. 

KRAMER: Do you have any prospects? 

GEORGE: No. 

KRAMER: You got anything on the horizon? 

GEORGE: Uh... no. 

KRAMER: Do you have any action at all? 

GEORGE: No. 

KRAMER: Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning? 

GEORGE: I like to get the Daily News!




GEORGE: Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it. 

ELAINE: You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? Alright here.



ELAINE: Here's your Christmas card! 




GEORGE: Every group has someone that they all make fun of, like us with Elaine.











ELAINE: You're bald! 

GEORGE: No I'm not. I was bald.





GEORGE: Elaine! 



GEORGE: No no no, Elaine! 

ELAINE: I don't like this thing! And here's what I'm doing with it! 



GEORGE: No! 










ELAINE: Stella!



ELAINE: Stella!






JERRY: Get your finger out of my face. 

ELAINE: You get yours out, I was here first! 

JERRY: I don't care. 

ELAINE: Get it out! 



KRAMER: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other?




GEORGE: Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating, that's a fantasy camp.






JERRY: Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers. 

KRAMER: Well, I wouldn't go as far as that. 

JERRY: You went back to the Jockeys 

KRAMER: Wrong again. 

JERRY: Oh no. 

ELAINE: What? What? 

JERRY: Don't you see what's going on here? No boxers, no Jockeys... 



ELAINE: Oh... 

JERRY: The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine. Kramer, say it isn't so. 

KRAMER: Oh, it be so. I'm out there Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!!!















KRAMER: Oh!



KRAMER: Hey! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise! 






JERRY: Kramer, he's just a dentist. 

KRAMER: Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite!

JERRY: I am not an anti-dentite!

KRAMER: You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools. 

JERRY: They do have their own schools! 



KRAMER: Yeah yeah yeah!




GEORGE: What kind of a person are you? 

JERRY: I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful 








JERRY: No no no no, oh no.






JERRY: Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism purely for the jokes. 

FATHER: And this offends you as a Jewish person. 

JERRY: No, it offends me as a comedian






JERRY: Oh gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later. 



JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home. 



JERRY: Well now you know how I feel.








JERRY: Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep! You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!



ELAINE: You look a little stressed.

JERRY: Oh I'm stressed!




GEORGE: Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you.

JERRY: Well ah...



JERRY: What? Kind of like this?



GEORGE: What are you doing?! What are you, crazy?!



ELAINE: Jerry!



JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing here?










ESTELLE: Oh my God! 











































































GEORGE: How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that. 

JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents. 






MORTY: I'm paying 

JERRY: Dad I'm paying 

MORTY: Get out of here. 

JERRY: You're not paying.






MORTY: I can't get it open. 



HELEN: Yay! Jerry got it open. 




GEORGE: How can you compare you parents to my parents?




FRANK: I told everybody about it! Everybody knows!



FRANK: I stopped short.






FRANK: Jerry, its Frank Costanza. Mr. Steinbrenner's here, George is dead, call me back!






ESTELLE: Georgie, I'm a divorcee. 

GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated. You're, you're a separatee. 

ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there George. 

GEORGE: No, you're not out there. 

ESTELLE: I am too! 

GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because I am out there. And if I see you out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!






GEORGE: This is delicious, Mrs. Ross. 

MRSROSS: Oh.

FRANK: Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So who's having sex with the hen? 

GEORGE: Why don't we talk about it another time. 

FRANK: But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing! 

MRSROSS: Something's missing alright. 

MRROSS: They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them. 

FRANK: That's perverse.
















































KRAMER: Hello and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one. 

GEORGE: Come on. Come on. 

KRAMER: Using your touch tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title now. 



KRAMER: You've selected... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one. 

GEORGE: What? 

KRAMER: Ah, you've selected... Brown Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one. 



KRAMER: Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.




LAURA: That couple is breaking up. 

GEORGE: They're breaking up? How do you know? 

JERRY: She reads lips.



GEORGE: Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me. 



JERRY: What? 



GEORGE: We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me. 



JERRY: She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvahs. 



GEORGE: Look, it's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off. 



JERRY: I don't know George. I'm not sure about this. 



GEORGE: Could you ask her? Just ask her. If she says no, case closed. 



JERRY: Alright. 

JERRY: Uh Laura, George was wondering if... 

LAURA: Sure. I'll do it.




ELAINE: Hi there. Um, uh...



ELAINE: Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and um... what is that right there? Is that lima bean? 

SOUPNAZI: Yes. 

ELAINE: Never been a big fan.



ELAINE: Um, you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "Scent Of A Woman."



SOUPNAZI: Very good. Very good. You know something? 

ELAINE: Hmm? 

SOUPNAZI: No soup for you!! 

ELAINE: What? 

SOUPNAZI: Come back one year! 






LELAND: Kramer, I've been reviewing your work. Quite frankly, it stinks. 

KRAMER: Well, I ah, been having trouble at home and uh, I mean ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes. 

LELAND: No no, I don't think that's going to do it. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all. I don't know what this is supposed to be! 

KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, just trying to get ahead. 

LELAND: Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on. 

KRAMER: I don't even really work here! 

LELAND: That's what makes this so difficult.




ELAINE: I will never understand people 

JERRY: They're the worst.









BANIA: Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!






KRAMER: Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.






MRSZANFINO: Goodnight, honey.

MICKEY: Goodnight.








JERRY: Come on Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis!






KRAMER: You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff and I need it bad baby, because I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out. 



PETERMAN: Not on my watch!



PETERMAN: I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!







JERRY: Look at you, you're disgusting. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.




JERRY: Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that? 

TIMWHATLEY: Why not? I'm Jewish, remember? 

JERRY: I know, but... 

TIMWHATLEY: Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for three thousand years. 

JERRY: Five thousand 

TIMWHATLEY: Five thousand, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of fluoride.




JACK: What do you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.

MORTY: Ah! 

JACK: Ah!

JERRY: Ah!






JACKIECHILES: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? Where the hell did you get that damn balm anyway? 

KRAMER: The Maestro. 

JACKIECHILES: The who?






POPPIE: Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personally going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey. 








AIDSWALKERTWO: Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! 



BOB: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? 








NEWMAN: Hello Jerry, may I come in?






ELAINE: Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. 

JERRY: No, there's less.






NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld

HELEN: Hello, Newman.






NEWMAN: Excellent.



NEWMAN: Excellent.




JERRY: I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.






NEWMAN: Alright, alright. Alright you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.






NEWMAN: Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times... 



NEWMAN: Ah! Ah! Ah ah. Oh, oh the humanity! Ah! 






GEORGE: "Believe it or not, George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home." 





BETH: Oh, well you know its funny George. Sometimes you don't know how you're really feeling about something until a person like you comes along and articulates it so perfectly. 

GEORGE: Oh, articulate.



















JERRY: Oh, right right right right right right right.



















GEORGE: Ah ha!!






KRAMER: Aw aw...








JERRY: Alright!






JERRY: Alright!




NEWMAN: Jumbalaya.




JERRY: Are we finished?

KRAMER: Done.
