

KRAMER: I wouldn't walk over there.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.

JERRY: What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.

KRAMER: I'd much rather get hit by an eighty pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.

JERRY: No, cab's coming in right here. Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.

KRAMER: Much rather take it to the head, like I did in seventy-nine.

JERRY: You were living in the village then, right?

KRAMER: Don't really remember.






ELAINE: Toxic waste green.

JERRY: That is disgusting.

ELAINE: You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.

JERRY: Well, then you're driving me wild.

ELAINE: I had them done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwing.



JERRY: Oh, why you having a party?  

ELAINE: I drive my people hard and then I reward them.

JERRY: Like with dogs.

ELAINE: Exactly.

GEORGE: Party?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Food?

ELAINE: Uh huh.

GEORGE: Bar?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: George?

JERRY: He's gonna show up anyway.

ELAINE: George, I just don't want you interfering.

GEORGE: How could I possibly interfere?

JERRY: Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?




GEORGE: Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out?



GEORGE: She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?

ANNA: No thanks.

GEORGE: Hi ah, my name is George.

ANNA: Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?

GEORGE: No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.

ANNA: Oh. Excuse me.



GEORGE: So...

DUGAN: How about leading us in a toast?

ELAINE: Oh sure. Hey guys, I want to make a toast. Um, here's to us who wish us well and those who don't can go to hell.



ELAINE: Alright, who's dancing? Come on, who's dancing? You want me, you want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew!



ELAINE: Whew! Come on guys, what's the hold up?





GEORGE: Sweet fancy Moses!




KRAMER: You get the tickets?

JERRY: Who needs two?



KRAMER: Oh, mama ceda!



JERRY: Special sneak preview of Death Blow.

KRAMER: Death Blow. When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but because of different reasons altogether.



JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.



KRAMER: Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?

JERRY: Kramer, you know what I had to go through to get these?

KRAMER: I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.



JERRY: Yeah I guess I do owe you.

KRAMER: Uh listen, you want me to stay here till George gets up?

JERRY: No, I'm okay.

KRAMER: There's no problem, really.

JERRY: I'm fine.

GEORGE: Go on. He's right in there boy.



JERRY: Hey, how was the party?

GEORGE: Food was good.

JERRY: Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?

GEORGE: Well, actually you did miss one little nugget of entertainment. Have you ever seen Elaine dance?

JERRY: Elaine danced?

GEORGE: It was more like a full body dry heave set to music.

JERRY: Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?

GEORGE: What, you mean you know about this?

JERRY: For some time.



JERRY: It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.

GEORGE: Well, sometimes you can't help these people till they hit rock bottom.

JERRY: And by then you've lost interest.

GEORGE: Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. Sixty-eight GTO.

JERRY: What made him get that thing?

GEORGE: During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.

JERRY: Not a very long trip.



KRAMER: Brody's in.

JERRY: I don't even have the extra ticket yet.

KRAMER: Well, you better get on the horn.




ELAINE: I'm telling you Jerry I'm getting a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me.



JERRY: How could that be?

ELAINE: Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?

JERRY: No, George was there, he said he had a great time.

ELAINE: Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.

JERRY: Oh, what are you talking about?

ELAINE: He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company and the next thing you know the entire staff's infected.

JERRY: Now you're talking crazy!

ELAINE: Alright Jerry, if that's not what it is you tell me. What is it?



JERRY: Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get going.




ANNA: You have a minute to approve some copy?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did you have a good time at the party last night?

ANNA: It was a real... kick.

ELAINE: Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?

ANNA: As a matter of fact I did.

ELAINE: Ah ha. Well listen, you would be wise to keep your distance from him.

ANNA: Why? He seems harmless.

ELAINE: Oh he's not. He's very harmful.

ANNA: Really?

ELAINE: Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.

ANNA: And you two are friends?

ELAINE: Yeah, we're good friends.




GEORGE: So this Anna called me from out of the blue.

JERRY: Really? I thought you were rebuffed.

GEORGE: With extreme prejudice.

JERRY: Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.

GEORGE: No no. that's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.

JERRY: Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.

GEORGE: I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.

JERRY: You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...

GEORGE: Yes... yes, yes.

JERRY: The bad fiancee, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...

GEORGE: Okay, the point is made.

JERRY: The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen...



JERRY: The bad tipper!




JERRY: Half of show business is here.

KRAMER: There's Brody. Brody! Over here.

BRODY: Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.

JERRY: That's quite a feed bag you're working on there.

BRODY: It's for all of us. Is there a problem?

KRAMER: Brody, come on. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.

JERRY: I'm a joke maker.

KRAMER: Alright, here we go, Death Blow.



JERRY: Hey hey, what the hell is he doing?

KRAMER: Relax, he does that all the time.

JERRY: Does what?

KRAMER: He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street.

JERRY: May I see you outside for a moment please?

KRAMER: But I want to...

JERRY: Outside!




ELAINE: Hey, have you seen Anna?

WORKER: Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.

ELAINE: To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?

WORKER: The park, why?

ELAINE: Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!




JERRY: What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?

KRAMER: Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.

JERRY: It's not legitimate.

KRAMER: It's a business.

JERRY: Where did you meet this guy?

KRAMER: He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramirez up on ninety-fourth street? One day he and I are playing Pachinko...

JERRY: Kramer.



KRAMER: Man, we're missing the Death Blow!

JERRY: I don't believe this.






ANNA: You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

GEORGE: No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I uh, scare you?

ANNA: No... a little. Nice car.

GEORGE: Yeah, she's a sweet ride.

ANNA: Is that your orthopedic back pillow?

GEORGE: Maybe.

ANNA: Well is it or isn't it?

GEORGE: Guess not.



ELAINE: Stay away from her.

GEORGE: I didn't do nothing.

ELAINE: Get in the car.

ANNA: But...

ELAINE: You heard me young lady, get in the car. And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.

GEORGE: Lighten up.






KRAMER: Go get them, Death Blow! You okay?



BRODY: Uh, I got a cramp.

KRAMER: Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.

BRODY: Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.

JERRY: Hey, what is going on over there?

BRODY: Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.

JERRY: Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.

KRAMER: Jerry, if the man is in pain...

JERRY: Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.



BRODY: What are you some kind of tough guy?

KRAMER: Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.

JERRY: Alright, I'm, I'm taking the camera.

KRAMER: Come on, let's go.

JERRY: Oh man...




KRAMER: Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?

JERRY: How was the rest of Death Blow?

KRAMER: Yeah, who got the final Death Blow because I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it coming to him!

JERRY: Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!

KRAMER: He's quite a character, isn't he?

JERRY: You know, he came by here at three o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!



KRAMER: I got it. Yep.

BRODY: Brody.

KRAMER: Come on up. It's Brody.

JERRY: What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.

KRAMER: Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.

JERRY: What if I didn't do it right?

KRAMER: It's your first time. He'll understand.

JERRY: People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.



KRAMER: Hey, Brody!

JERRY: Hi.

BRODY: Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.

JERRY: Yeah.

BRODY: I've never seen such beautiful work.

JERRY: What?

BRODY: You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.

JERRY: Well, I did the best I could.

BRODY: I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.



BRODY: May I use your phone?

KRAMER: Uh yeah. It's under the couch.



KRAMER: Look at you! You've got another gig!

JERRY: I don't want another gig! I'm not doing this.

KRAMER: But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talking feature films.

JERRY: We're talking federal crime here.



BRODY: I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. May I borrow this?



KRAMER: Sure, do you need a glove?

BRODY: Nah.




DUGAN: I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust...



ELAINE: What? What is so funny?



ANNA: Sorry, I got hung up.

ELAINE: At Yankee Stadium?

ANNA: This? It's mine.

ELAINE: Oh really? Because it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.

ANNA: He's not stocky.



ELAINE: Who did that? Who did that?!?




KRAMER: The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious.






JERRY: No no no no no no no! What were you thinking when you shot this?

KRAMER: That's fine.

JERRY: Do you even know what this scene is about?

KRAMER: It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.

JERRY: No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.



KRAMER: What? Where?

JERRY: Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.

KRAMER: Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.

JERRY: I don't care about Brody. I was up on ninety-sixth street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.

KRAMER: So you'll do the movie?



JERRY: I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?

KRAMER: Right here.



ELAINE: Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.



ELAINE: What?



KRAMER: This umpf thing.

ELAINE: It's dancing.

KRAMER: No no, that ain�t dancing, Sally.

ELAINE: I dance fine.

KRAMER: You stink.



ELAINE: He doesn't know what he's talking about. Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?

JERRY: I forgot to make my bed.



ELAINE: Jerry, do I stink?

JERRY: Alright, you're beyond stink.

ELAINE: But I really enjoy dancing.

JERRY: And that's not helping either. That's why you're having trouble with your staff, not because of George.

ELAINE: It's that bad?

JERRY: Have you ever seen yourself?



JERRY: Ah ah please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.








ELAINE: George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I want to say to both of you.

GEORGE: Yo, Anna.

ANNA: Hi, George. What're you up to?



GEORGE: You don't want to know.

ELAINE: Uh, well listen, I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.

GEORGE: What, what, what're you talking about?

ELAINE: Well George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.

GEORGE: Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!

ELAINE: I never should have given Anna the impression...

GEORGE: Pick it up, pick it up!

ELAINE: ...that you're a bad seed. I mean, you're a fine seed.

GEORGE: Elaine, get off the speaker!



ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: You are ruining everything.

ELAINE: I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, that's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.

ELAINE: George, I don't have time for this. Uh Anna, do you want to talk to George?

ANNA: Um no, I don't think so.

ELAINE: No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye George. We'll see you.

GEORGE: I'm a bad man!




BRODY: So where's the tape?

JERRY: No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.

BRODY: I need the tape.

JERRY: You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys running them. I want to be able to talk to them.

BRODY: Are you out of your mind?

JERRY: Kramer...

KRAMER: I know, Jerry. It's okay.



KRAMER: Yeah look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dying to do it. But if you don't make him happy the work suffers. And then nobody's happy.

BRODY: Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!

JERRY: Alright. That's it, I can't work like this.

KRAMER: Jerry...

JERRY: I'm off the project.



KRAMER: Jerry!

BRODY: I want the tape.

KRAMER: Yeah.




GEORGE: Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?

JERRY: They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.

GEORGE: Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.

JERRY: Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer.



KRAMER: Listen man, you gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!

JERRY: Kramer, I'm not doing this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...

GEORGE: Did you say dangerous?




GEORGE: I'm a bootlegger.

ANNA: You're a what?

GEORGE: I'm bootlegging a movie, baby!

ANNA: Isn't that illegal?

GEORGE: I can do hard time for this one. And community service!

ANNA: Is this your FiberCon?



GEORGE: Get out of my way!




KRAMER: Jerry, George got arrested.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah. He went down at the Beackman. He tried to lam, but they cheesed him.

JERRY: Oh, now I see.



JERRY: Yeah.

BRODY: Brody, I'm coming up.

JERRY: What're we gonna do?

KRAMER: Well, I uh, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?

JERRY: I think that's it.



JERRY: Sweet fancy Moses!

KRAMER: Jerry, she taped over the whole ending!



BRODY: Where's the tape?

JERRY: Uh, well. It uh...

BRODY: Is that it?

KRAMER: Uh yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.

BRODY: How'd it turn out?

JERRY: Uh... great.

KRAMER: Although the whole story kind of comes apart at the end there.

JERRY: Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a disturbing image.

JERRY: Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.




ANNA: It's alright, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.

GEORGE: Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that?



ELAINE: Anna...

ANNA: Oh Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.

ELAINE: Alright. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office.



FRANK: Okay, where's my boy?

GEORGE: Oh my God.

FRANK: I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger?



GEORGE: Ow! Dad...

FRANK: Who put you up to this, was it her?

ELAINE: Alright. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.

FRANK: My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.

ELAINE: You got that right.

FRANK: What the hell does that mean?

ELAINE: That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.

FRANK: You saying you want a piece of me?

ELAINE: I could drop you like a bag of dirt.

FRANK: You want to piece of me? You got it!






JERRY: But he's an old man, Elaine.

ELAINE: Well, he wrote the check and I cashed it.



JERRY: Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.

ELAINE: Oh, Cry Cry Again, I want to see that.

JERRY: No you don't.

VENDER: You shot Death Blow?

JERRY: Yeah.

VENDER: That was brilliant.

JERRY: Thank you.



ELAINE: You were big.

JERRY: I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?

ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.

JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it.
