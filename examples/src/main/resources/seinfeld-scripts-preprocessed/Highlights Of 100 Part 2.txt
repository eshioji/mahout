



JERRY: Oh, Hi. I didn't realize you'd be back so soon. You know after a hundred episodes this apartment has really seen a lot of action. George, Kramer, that girl...



JERRY: Elaine. But in the end it's really a show about people.



JERRY: People who really care about each other and I think that says something... I guess... I don't know. Just watch.













JERRY: I, I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.

JERRY: He's got super strength, super speed, I'm sure he's got super humor.

GEORGE: Either you're born with a sense of humor or you're not, it's not going to change. Even if you go from the red sun of Krypton...



GEORGE: ...all the way to the yellow sun of the earth.



JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind...



JERRY: ...not be affected by the yellow sun of the earth?

GEORGE: I don't know. But he ain't funny.






KRAMER: What's today?

NEWMAN: It's Thursday.

KRAMER: Really? Feels like Tuesday.

NEWMAN: Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel...

KRAMER: I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...

JERRY: Alright, shut up the both of you!






TIMMY: You double dipped the chip!

GEORGE: "Double dipped"? What, what are you talking about?

TIMMY: You dipped the chip. You took a bite.



TIMMY: And you dipped again.

GEORGE: So?

TIMMY: That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip, just take one dip and end it!






DRRESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Um, coffee? Anything?

KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, do you have a uh, decaf cappuccino?

DRRESTON: I don't think we have that.

KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.

DRRESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink

DRRESTON: This is an office.

KRAMER: That's true.






ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa and my diaphragm goes flying.



ELAINE: So I just froze, you know, ah! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there.



ELAINE: So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed. So I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? 


ELAINE: Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?



ELAINE: Ah.






KRAMER: I hate Keith Hernandez, hate him.

NEWMAN: I despise him.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

KRAMER: Let me tell it.

NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it.

KRAMER: You always tell it.

NEWMAN: Alright, tell it.

KRAMER: Just tell it

NEWMAN: June fourteenth nineteen eighty-seven. Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp.



KRAMER: Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us. As he passes Newman he turns and says, "Nice game pretty boy." Keith continued past us up the ramp.

NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.

ELAINE: What was it?

KRAMER: He spit on us, and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet off him and it hit me.

ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times. Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then came off the rib, turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in mid air mind you, makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic loogie.









JERRY: Because I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.

GEORGE: Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.






KRAMER: She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster doofus. Am I a hipster doofus?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face. Huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?



GEORGE: You're very attractive.

KRAMER: Yeah.






ELAINE: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?






JERRY: We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean it's fine if that's who you are.

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends.

GEORGE: My father is gay.

SHARON: Look, I know, I know what I heard.

JERRY: Heard, it was a joke.

GEORGE: Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! Come on, let's go baby! Come on!



KRAMER: Hey, Come on! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: No steam! No steam!

KRAMER: Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!






GEORGE: You faked?

ELAINE: On occasion.

JERRY: And the guy never knows?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: How can he not know that?

ELAINE: Because I was good.

JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.



ELAINE: You didn't know.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: You didn't know.

JERRY: Are you saying...



GEORGE: I think I'll have a piece of cake.

JERRY: With me?

ELAINE: Well...

JERRY: You faked with me?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You faked with me?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: You faked it?

ELAINE: I faked it.

JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?

ELAINE: Not bad huh?

JERRY: What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?



ELAINE: Fake fake fake fake.






GEORGE: I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I got it all!






ELAINE: Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.

JERRY: Don't say that.

ELAINE: It's true. I'm George! I'm George!






WAITRESS: Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.

GEORGE: Yeah. No no no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of tuna on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, not toasted with a side of potato salad... and a cup of tea.



ELAINE: Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.

JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, because salmon swim against the current...



JERRY: ...and the tuna swim with it.



GEORGE: Good for the tuna.



ELAINE: Ah, George, you know that woman just looked at you.

GEORGE: So what? What am I supposed to do?

ELAINE: Go talk to her.

GEORGE: Elaine, bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don't approach strange women.

JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.

GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.

JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.

GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day. So now I will do the opposite and I will do something!



GEORGE: Excuse me, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.

VICTORIA: Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.



GEORGE: My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.

VICTORIA: I'm Victoria. Hi.








JERRY: Oh... You mean... shrinkage.

GEORGE: Yes. Significant shrinkage.

JERRY: So you feel you were short changed.

GEORGE: Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.

JERRY: Well, so what's the difference?

GEORGE: What if she discusses it with Jane?

JERRY: Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

GEORGE: How do you know?

JERRY: Women aren't like us.

GEORGE: They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?

JERRY: No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.

GEORGE: How do women know about shrinkage?

JERRY: Isn't it common knowledge?



GEORGE: Elaine!

JERRY:  Elaine! Get!



GEORGE: Do women know about shrinkage?

ELAINE: What do you mean, like laundry?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...

ELAINE: It shrinks?

JERRY: Like a frightened turtle!

ELAINE: Why does it shrink?

GEORGE: It just does.

ELAINE: I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.






RUSSELL: Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times... and every time I read it...



JERRY: What?

RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second.



JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet.



GEORGE: Do you think he liked it?



JERRY: I'm not sure.

































KRAMER: The air conditioner!



KRAMER: I think it got the dog!











GEORGE: My mother caught me. 

JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what? 

GEORGE: You know. I was alone...

ELAINE: You mean? 

GEORGE: Uh huh. 

KRAMER: She caught you? 



JERRY: Where? 

GEORGE: I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes. Nobody was there, they're supposed to be working. My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it...

JERRY: "Glamour"? 



GEORGE: So, one thing led to another...

JERRY: So, what did she do? 

GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint, she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. 

KRAMER: Man. 

GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up. 

JERRY: What did you do? 

GEORGE: I zipped up! 

ELAINE: So, she fell? 

GEORGE: Yeah. Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was! 

ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have done that.

JERRY: No, I wouldn't think so.  

GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital. 

ELAINE: How is she? 

GEORGE: She's in traction. 

ELAINE:  Okay, I'm sorry.

GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine. 

ELAINE: I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious. 

GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!" I said, "Because it's there!" 



JERRY: "Glamour"? 



GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you this, though. I am never doing... that... again. 

ELAINE: What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together? 

GEORGE: All together. 



ELAINE: Oh, give me a break.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right. 

KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop? 

JERRY: Come one.

ELAINE: Come on.
 
GEORGE: You don't think I can? 

JERRY: No chance. 

GEORGE: You think you could? 

JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. 

GEORGE: Care to make it interesting? 

JERRY: Sure, how much? 

GEORGE: A hundred dollars. 

JERRY: You're on. 

KRAMER: Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this.

JERRY: You? 

KRAMER: Yeah. 

JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check. 

ELAINE: I want to be in on this, too. 

GEORGE: No no no.

JERRY: Oh no. It's apples and oranges. No no no.

ELAINE: Why? 

JERRY: It's apples and oranges.

ELAINE: What? Why? Why? 

JERRY: Because you're a woman! 

ELAINE: So what? 

JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. 

ELAINE: Oh. 

JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh... shaving. 

ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs. 

KRAMER: Not everyday. 

GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in? 

ELAINE: Yeah! 

GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one, you gotta put up two hundred dollars. 

KRAMER: No, a thousand! 

ELAINE: No, I'll, I'll put up one fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one fifty. 

JERRY: Okay, one fifty. 

GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing? 

JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well. I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 

KRAMER: Alright.













GEORGE: Fire!!








MEL: We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little... bubble boy.



MEL: Excuse me, I ah...

ELAINE: Oh right here.










KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.






ELAINE: Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean.








JERRY: In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up. 

MANYA: I had a pony. 



JERRY: Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se. 

MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony. So, what's wrong with that? 

JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing� 

MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him. 

JERRY: Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony? 

MANYA: You! You said so!








SUSAN: It's my father's cabin! 

GEORGE: Um, I just realized. You never gave me back the change from the tolls.






JAKE: So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit? 



ELAINE: Well... the counter... was right there and...






JERRY: I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.






DOCTOR: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse... retractor. 



JERRY: What are you eating? 

KRAMER: Junior Mints. Do you want one? 

JERRY: No. 

KRAMER: Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst... 



KRAMER: Could you get... 



KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Where'd you get those? 

KRAMER: The machine. You want one? 

JERRY: No. 

KRAMER: Here, take one. 

JERRY: I don't want one. 

KRAMER: No, they're good! Take one. 

JERRY: I don't want any! 

KRAMER: Just take one. 

JERRY: No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it! 





JERRY: It's a Junior Mint.




ELAINE: Drake's Coffee Cake.








JERRY: Snapple?

MARLA: No thanks.





ELAINE: Snapple?

MARLA: No thanks.






JERRY: Pez?

NOEL: Uh, no.






ELAINE: Box of Jujyfruits.








KRAMER: Clark Bar.






JERRY: Oh I love Yoo Hoo.






NEWMAN: Oh Joltons.






ELAINE: Chocolate Bobka.



GEORGE: It's Gore-Tex.








MERYL: Cashmere?

JERRY: No, it's Gore-Tex.






KRAMER: Who's going to turn down a Junior Mint. It's chocolate, it's peppermint, it's delicious!

JERRY: That's true.

KRAMER: It's very refreshing!






DIANE: What's going on over here? 

WOMANATBEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying. 

MANATBEACH: Is anyone here a marine biologist? 







GEORGE: The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli! 



GEORGE: I got about fifty feet out and suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell you he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said: "Easy big fellow!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! 

JERRY: Mammal. 

GEORGE: Whatever. 

KRAMER: Well then, what did you do next? 

GEORGE: Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, face to face with the blow hole. I, I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but I knew something was there. So I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction! 





KRAMER: What is that, a Titleist? 



KRAMER: A hole in one eh?






JERRY: So we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing. 

GEORGE: Exactly. 

JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing." 

GEORGE: There you go. 



JERRY: I think you may have something here.











GEORGE: Look, why don't you two just go to the movies by yourself. I'm not in the mood 

ELAINE: Well me either. I'm going to Sky Burger. 

JERRY: So you're not going? 

ELAINE: You don't need us. 

JERRY: I can't go to a bad movie by myself. What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers? I guess I'll just go to my uncle's. 

GEORGE: Should we tell him we're leaving? 

ELAINE: What for? Let's just get out of here! 



BRUCE: Seinfeld, four.
