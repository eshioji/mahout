

KRAMER: Look how dark it's getting already.

JERRY: Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER: When does it start?

JERRY: I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER: Well, I'm sick of waiting.



KRAMER: I am springing ahead right now.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.



JERRY: Oh God, it's Mike Moffit.

KRAMER: Oh now don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY: I'm not a phony and I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER: Hey! Mike!



MIKE: Kramer! Jerry! How's it going?!

JERRY: Fine. And I'm not just saying that.

MIKE: Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY: No openings in arson?

MIKE: Either of you guys wanna place a bet, I'm your guy.

KRAMER: Ah no no no. No bets for me. I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY: I'm feeling a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years.



MIKE: Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER: You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE: Hey, what time you got?



KRAMER: Oh yes. Uh, it's almost six.

MIKE: Whoa, I'm really late.






ELAINE: Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY: Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman is gonna love them.



PEGGY: Thanks, Susie.






ELAINE: You won't believe this but as I'm leaving she calls me "Susie."

JERRY: I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE: What am I, a bulimic, chain smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY: Who are you describing?

ELAINE: Someone I know.

JERRY: Named Sharon?

ELAINE: I'd rather not say.



GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Mmm! What's in the bag?

GEORGE: New tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green!

JERRY: Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE: It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY: You taking Allison?

GEORGE: Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe.

JERRY: Live?

ELAINE: Lithe.

GEORGE: Live?

ELAINE: Lithe!

JERRY: Oh, lithe!

ELAINE: Well, you two will have a great time there.

JERRY: It can't be worse than this.

GEORGE: Wait till you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! I'm finally gonna make a great entrance!

ELAINE: Backless? You gonna back her in?

GEORGE: Elaine, when a woman makes a ball entrance she twirls.



ELAINE: She's not gonna twirl.

GEORGE: She'll twirl.






GEORGE: That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants everyone to twirl around.

ALLISON: Alright.

GEORGE: Hey! Uh listen, did you get your uh, boss's Knick ticket for Kramer?

ALLISON: Yeah, here.



GEORGE: Oh! Great!

ALLISON: Uh, say George...

GEORGE: Whoa! Courtside! Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

ALLISON: George. We need to talk.

GEORGE: What?

ALLISON: I really think we need to talk.

GEORGE: Uh oh.




JERRY: She wants to talk.

GEORGE: She doesn't want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY: Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE: Who would want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY: What'd you do?

GEORGE: I told her I was out of soda. I went out to get some and I never went back.

JERRY: All night?!

GEORGE: Yeah, I slept at my parents house.

JERRY: And she wants to break up with you.

GEORGE: Ha! Can you believe it? I'm supposed to be having lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY: Uh oh. Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's.

GEORGE: So? What am I gonna do?

JERRY: You really like this girl?

GEORGE: No. I like the ball! This is my one chance to make a great entrance! My whole life I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY: You've made some fine exits.

GEORGE: Alright.

JERRY: So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE: Why not? If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still going out, she has to go to the ball.



KRAMER: Hey. Oh listen, did you get my ticket from Allison?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, right here.



KRAMER: Alright! Yeah, courtside. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away.



GEORGE: She'll have to find me first.



KRAMER: Alright. Oh, by the way, you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY: What for?

KRAMER: Well I put a bet down for you on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oh! That's some sweet action!

JERRY: But I don't want any sweet action.

KRAMER: Well, I couldn't do it. I got a gambling problem.

JERRY: So you put down my money?!

KRAMER: You don't have a problem.

JERRY: Not with that, no.




PEGGY: Susie? Susie!

ELAINE: Uh, hi Peggy. Um look, I should have said this yesterday, but...

PEGGY: Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE: Yeah. See that...

PEGGY: You know it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt. She practically ran the company into the ground.

ELAINE: Well, I thought she did a pretty good job.

PEGGY: I heard she was a disaster, Suze.

ELAINE: Look it. It's not Suze. Alright? It's Suzie. My name is Suzie!








GEORGE: "Believe it or not, George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home." 




JERRY: George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: So, coffee shop?

GEORGE: No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure.



GEORGE: Hey, I got another call coming in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.



GEORGE: "Believe it or not, George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home." 




ALLISON: George? Are you there? I hate that stupid message. I know you're avoiding me. I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you.





GEORGE: Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home. I probably should have tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from you, really looking forward to the ball.






ELAINE: Can you believe this woman?

JERRY: The nerve. Talking about you behind your back and right to your face!

ELAINE: No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no way I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY: No. No Suze.

ELAINE: I mean, what am I, some pom pom waving backseat bimbo?!

JERRY: Who are you describing?

ELAINE: Someone I know!

JERRY: Named Suze?

ELAINE: No, still Sharon!



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER: No. I was kicked out for fighting with one of the players.



JERRY: Wait. Way way way way way way wait! Who?!

KRAMER: Reggie Miller.

ELAINE: Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Hey hey hey wait, wait wait wait! What happened!

KRAMER: Well, first of all for some reason they started the game an hour late. And uh, I was sitting next to Spike Lee and he and Reggie were jawing at each other, so I guess I got involved.



ELAINE: Wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa!

JERRY: Well wait wait wait wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER: Well I ran out onto the court and threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." And they threw me and Reggie and Spike out of the game.

ELAINE: So that's it?

KRAMER: Well I, well I felt pretty bad about everything and uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club.



JERRY: Can you believe that?

ELAINE: I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.



KRAMER: The Knicks killed them a hundred and ten to seventy three!

JERRY: What, of course without Reggie Miller it's a blowout!

KRAMER: No Jerry, that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cool G, daddy O. Now you gotta let it ride!

JERRY: On what?!

KRAMER: Ah come on, Jerry, I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey, let's go down to the OTB. We'll put some money on the ponies.



JERRY: Yeah, alright.

KRAMER: Ah! They just closed!

JERRY: Oh. Too bad.




ELAINE: Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?

PETERMAN: Apparently Peggy down in design got into a little bit of a tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE: Susie?

PETERMAN: Yes. Between you, me and the lamp post and the desk, Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE: It's Susie.

PETERMAN: Nevertheless, Elaine. The House of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and Susie right here in my office.

ELAINE: Ah, all of, all of us?

 


KRAMER: Allison. Hi. Uh listen, I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen, could I have a ticket tonight because the Rockets are in town and that Hakeem Olajuwon? Oh, he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON: Kramer? Have you seen George around? I can't get a hold of him.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, he uh, visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.

ALLISON: Oh yeah?




JERRY: Believe it or not, George isn't at home.

MIKE: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Mike. How about those Knicks?

MIKE: Yeah! How about them? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY: Why not?

MIKE: Because I don't have the money.

JERRY: Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet and then you can't pay? I don't know Mike. To me it sounds a little, how you say, "phony"?

MIKE: Just give me till Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY: You know, you're supposed to be the bookie. Act like one.

MIKE: I'm sorry. Uh, oh here, let me give you a hand with that.




JERRY: Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE: Oh. Let me see.






GEORGE: So ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? And why Pomodoro?



CRYINGWOMAN: How could you say that to me?

KRAMER: Allison spoke to me and um, she wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE: Uh oh.

KRAMER: We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison and I think that the best thing to do is just make a clean break.

GEORGE: Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER: We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE: I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER: So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just a good time.

GEORGE: Are you?

KRAMER: What, me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE: I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER: George, we're sorry. We're through.

GEORGE: Kramer. Please.

KRAMER: I'm sorry.






ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I guess we should just get this over with.



PETERMAN: Just hold on a minute. Still one short.

ELAINE: Oh no, we're not.

PEGGY: Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN: Well, Elaine has nothing but good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE: Look. We don't have to name names, or point fingers, or name names! Me and her have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I and she and you.

PETERMAN: Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her and her.

ELAINE: Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN: Who?

ELAINE: Her?

PETERMAN: Where is she?!

ELAINE: Ah, this is part of the problem!

PEGGY: I thought I was part of this problem.

ELAINE: You're a huge part of the problem. But I think that at its core, this is a Susie and Elaine problem that requires a Susie and Elaine solution! And who better to do that than... Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN: Well, now that we have that cleared up why don't the three of us have lunch.



ELAINE: What?! Oh! Oh, I'm coming! I, I gotta go.



PETERMAN: She is the best. What was your name again?

 


KRAMER: Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY: Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER: Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY: Why is he scared?

KRAMER: Come on in. Did you do this?



JERRY: Yeah, but...

KRAMER: Uh ah ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY: It was an accident.

KRAMER: Oh, is that what you call it when somebody doesn't pay up?

MIKE: I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to reach in and take it!

JERRY: I don't want it that way.

KRAMER: Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your trunk, we call it even, and this way nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY: Fine.

MIKE: Oh uh, thank you Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good real good!



KRAMER: See that was nice, Jerry. Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY: Ah, it's just a car.



GEORGE: Hi.

KRAMER: Hi.



GEORGE: It's, funny running into you here.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. It's funny. You look good.

GEORGE: Do I? Thanks. You too.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. You know, it's getting kind of late. I, I really have to be going, so uh, it's nice seeing you again, alright.

GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah. Hey, hey you, you know maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER: George, it's over. It's just, it's over.



GEORGE: What do you think, Jerry?

JERRY: I don't know, I just see you guys together.

 


MIKE: Thumbs!



MIKE: Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!




JERRY: So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE: Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY: Yeah, I know how you feel.



ELAINE: Do you hear something?

JERRY: What?



JERRY: Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE: Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY: Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: Get rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE: I kind of like her.

JERRY: She's gone.

ELAINE: Jerry...

JERRY: Gone!



ELAINE: That bumper sticker.



MIKE: Oh God, I'm in trouble.




GEORGE: Kramer. Open up! I know you're in there!



KRAMER: Uh George, uh, it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you?

GEORGE: It's only four.

KRAMER: Huh?

GEORGE: I've been walking around all night. I've been thinking about Allison and me and you.

KRAMER: Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE: Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER: Uh, I know I'm gonna regret this. Alright.

GEORGE: Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER: Alright, alright, I'll see you later.



GEORGE: Woo!




PETERMAN: Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE: Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN: Mmm nah.

ELAINE: Alright then, I was gonna wait to tell you this but last night, Susie... she took her own life.



 


KRAMER: We're taking George back.

ALLISON: What?!

KRAMER: He's gonna make us very happy.






ELAINE: Look at this turnout.

JERRY: Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE: Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.



PEGGY: Oh my God! Susie?

ELAINE: Oh, oh I'm not Susie. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY: But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE: Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me.



PEGGY: I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY: Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.



JERRY: Her too.



ELAINE: What can you say about a girl like Susie?



 





KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Where's uh, where's Allison?

KRAMER: Oh Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE: But you took me back.

KRAMER: Well yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How do you like the tuxedo? It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. Alright, eh.

GEORGE: Where are you going?

KRAMER: The Ball, silly.

GEORGE: No no no no no. You're not going in there.

KRAMER: George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE: For her. Not for you.

KRAMER: Let's just try and have a nice time for once and we'll talk about this when we get home.



GEORGE: Alright, look, wait wait, Kramer wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not going in. Ah!



WILHELM: Wow! What an entrance! And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM: Oh. Ah ha.

 


ELAINE: And also, much like me, Susie hated going to the market.

PETERMAN: Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE: Oh God yes, Mr. Peterman.



PETERMAN: Ah. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie. And most of all, I will never forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Just the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was pretty good.



JERRY: Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of them.





PETERMAN: But I never heard her cries for help. And now Susie is gone.



MIKE: Hold on! Hold on! Susie didn't commit suicide!



MIKE: She was murdered, by Jerry Seinfeld!



JERRY: Not only that, I broke his thumbs.



 


PETERMAN: Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to form a charitable foundation in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman. I'm Susie. She's me.

PETERMAN: I feel the same way. And that's why this foundation will meet around your schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every free moment you have.





ELAINE: Suze!
