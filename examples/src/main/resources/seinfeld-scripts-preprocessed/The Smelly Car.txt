I'm sorry you're gonna have to give me the doggy bag. I couldn't make it." And it is embarrassing because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Let me tell you something, if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for a while either.




JERRY: Is that bothering you?

ELAINE: No, not at all.



JERRY: Uh, it's a BMW.

ELAINE: Oh, could you please hurry?

JERRY: "Please hurry." Look at you. Look what you've become.

ELAINE: What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything.

JERRY: You can't wait a few more minutes?

ELAINE: I don't want to keep him waiting.

JERRY: He'll like you more.

ELAINE: That's impossible.



WIFE: Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?

HUSBAND: Leave me alone.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm going to get married real soon. So where am I dropping you?

ELAINE: His place.

JERRY: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment.

ELAINE: And he gets the rest of my chicken.

JERRY: So, is tonight "the night?"

ELAINE: You never know.

JERRY: Oh! Baby doll!



JERRY: Thank you brother.



JERRY: Boy, do you smell something?

ELAINE: Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of course I smell something.

JERRY: What is it?

ELAINE: I think it's B O!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: It's B O. The valet must have had B O.

JERRY: It can't be. Nobody has B O like this.

ELAINE: Jerry. It's B O.

JERRY: But the whole car smells.

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: So when somebody has B O the O usually stays with the B. Once the B leaves, the O goes with it.






ELAINE: I can't believe you ski!

CARL: I'm a great skier.

ELAINE: Yeah? What else?

CARL: Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...

ELAINE: You "pillage and plunder?"

CARL: When I travel.

ELAINE: See? Finally, finally I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.






GEORGE: This'll only take a second.

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm going to poke around.





GEORGE: Hey, what do you know? Look at that! A lesbian sighting. Oh my lucky day. They're so fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that.





GEORGE: Oh my God! It's Susan! What do I do?



SUSAN: George?

GEORGE: Ah! Susan!

SUSAN: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!

SUSAN: Renting a video! What do you got there?

GEORGE: Oh, some stupid movie.

SUSAN: This is Mona.



GEORGE: Oh, hi.

MONA: Pleasure to meet you.

GEORGE: Yes, well...

MONA: Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.

SUSAN: You okay?

GEORGE: Yeah. Yes! I just uh, haven't seen you in a long time.

SUSAN: And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.

GEORGE: Oh, please! Me? Come on! That's great! Are you kidding? I think thatï¿½s fantastic! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?

SUSAN: I know who I'm talking to.

GEORGE: Of course you do. It's just uh, you know, I, I never knew uh, that uh...

SUSAN: I liked women?

GEORGE: There you go.

GEORGE: So, uh, how long has this been going on?

SUSAN: Since you and I broke up.

GEORGE: So, after me you... went that way?

SUSAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.



SUSAN: So, what have you got there?

GEORGE: Oh, I uh...

SUSAN: Oh, "Rochelle, Rochelle."

GEORGE: It's uh, a foreign movie, a film is what it is actually.

SUSAN: Yeah, a lot of nudity in that, huh?

GEORGE: No no no, just a tiny bit. It's not even frontal nudity. It's... sidal nudity.

VIDEOCLERK: Next.

GEORGE: Oh, that's me.

SUSAN: Alright, well... good seeing you George.

GEORGE: Yes, good to see you too. And good luck with uh... with the whole thing there.

VIDEOCLERK: Uh, what are you returning?

GEORGE: Uh, "Rochelle, Rochelle."

VIDEOCLERK: Ah, "Rochelle, Rochelle". "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk."

GEORGE: Yeah.



VIDEOCLERK: Uh, that'll be uh, three forty-nine.

GEORGE: Three forty-nine? It says one forty-nine.

VIDEOCLERK: Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a two dollar charge for not rewinding.

GEORGE: What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage! What are you...

KRAMER: George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.

GEORGE: I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again.




JERRY: So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time the odor molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify.

ELAINE: Right.

JERRY: I open the car door, like a punch in the face, the stench hits me. It's almost as if it had gained strength throughout the night.

ELAINE: You know I can think of at least six known offensive odors that I would rather smell than what's living in your car.

JERRY: What about skunk?

ELAINE: I don't mind skunk.

JERRY: Horse manure?

ELAINE: I love horse manure.

JERRY: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want two hundred and fifty dollars to detail it and get the smell out.

ELAINE: Oh!

JERRY: I'm not paying for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm driving up to that restaurant now and demand they pay for it.

ELAINE: Absolutely.

ELAINE: Uh listen, let me ask you something. Um, when you're with a guy and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?

JERRY: It means he's lying.

ELAINE: Wow.

JERRY: Why? Is that what he told you?

ELAINE: Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... men have to get up early some time.

JERRY: No. Never.

ELAINE: Jerry! I'm sure I've seen men on the street early in the morning.

JERRY: Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will always trade sleep for sex.

ELAINE: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?

JERRY: Anything's possible.



KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: What's the matter with you?

KRAMER: Steinbrenner! He's ruining my life.

JERRY: Oh yeah, Steinbrenner.

KRAMER: I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek, McGriff...

JERRY: I know the list.

KRAMER: What's that smell?

JERRY: What smell?



KRAMER: Oh, you stink.



JERRY: What, what do you mean I stink?

KRAMER: You stink. Why don't you go take a shower?

JERRY: I showered! Oh, wait a second, since I showered I've been in the car!

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!

ELAINE: If it attached itself to you... Oh my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B O! Me!

KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: I'm coming right down.

KRAMER: Alright, what happened?

JERRY: What happened? My car stinks is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in its path.

 


GEORGE: What is that? B O?

JERRY: Yes.

GEORGE: This is unbelievable B O.

JERRY: I know. I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his thirty-eight years in the business he's never smelled anything like it.

GEORGE: So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?

JERRY: No no, it's the valet guy.

GEORGE: No no, I mean, driven Susan to lesbianism.

JERRY: Oh no, that's ridiculous.

GEORGE: What if her experience with me drove her to it?

JERRY: Suicide maybe, not lesbianism.

GEORGE: The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's never been with a guy.

JERRY: Hmm.

GEORGE: Oh this isn't even B O! This is beyond B O! It's B B O!

JERRY: There should be a B O squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo" to sniff them out, strip them down and wash them with a big, soapy brush.

GEORGE: You know the funny thing is, somehow I, I find her more appealing now. It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.

JERRY: Let me see if I understand this... on second thought.




JERRY: Here he is, that's the guy!



JERRY: No thank you, go back, no go back! No back, back, go back, I got it, I'll park it! I'll park it! You, you go back! Sorry, thank you no.





SNOOTYMAITRED: What do you mean, "stunk up"?

JERRY: I mean the car stinks! George, does the car stink?

GEORGE: Stinks.

JERRY: Stinks!

SNOOTYMAITRED: Well, perhaps you're the one who has the odor.

JERRY: Hey, I've never smelled in my life buddy!

SNOOTYMAITRED: Really? Well I can smell you now.

JERRY: That's from the car!

SNOOTYMAITRED: Well, maybe you're the one who stunk up the car rather than the car stinking up you!

GEORGE: Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.

JERRY: Thank you very much. Well, then go out and smell the car, see which smells worse.

SNOOTYMAITRED: I don't have time to smell cars.

GEORGE: Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source.

JERRY: You've gotta smell the car.

SNOOTYMAITRED: I'm a busy man.

JERRY: Come on! One whiff!

SNOOTYMAITRED: Oh alright, one whiff.



SNOOTYMAITRED: Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. Will you pay for the cleaning?

SNOOTYMAITRED: Yes! Fifty dollars! I'll give you fifty dollars!

JERRY: Fifty dollars? I don't think that's going to cover it.



SNOOTYMAITRED: Whatever you want! I'll give you whatever you want!



JERRY: I want half, one twenty-five!

SNOOTYMAITRED: Yes! Yes! One twenty-five is good, now please open the door!





JERRY: Alright.



GEORGE: Oh my God.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: The video! Someone stole the video right out the car!

JERRY: Someone stole "Rochelle Rochelle?"

SNOOTYMAITRED: Well you left the window open.

JERRY: He had to air out the car.

GEORGE: You know you should pay for it! 

SNOOTYMAITRED: I'm not paying for that. They've already got my seven dollars. "Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk."




CARL: The valet had such bad B O?

ELAINE: Oh man, just rampant, mutant B O. The O went from the valet's B, to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry, Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampooed, so...



CARL: That's a relief.

ELAINE: Yeah.



ELAINE: What?

CARL: It's still there.

ELAINE: No no no! It can't be! I, I shampooed! I rinsed! I repeated!

CARL: It's still there, I smelled it.



ELAINE: I don't smell anything. Here, take another smell.



CARL: No.

ELAINE: No here, just one more smell.





CARL: Please!






VIDEOCLERK: Could you repeat that again?

GEORGE: Rochelle Rochelle.

SUSAN: George.

GEORGE: Oh, thanks for meeting me here.

SUSAN: Yeah, I don't have much time.

GEORGE: Listen, yeah, I gotta ask you, I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your uh... metamorphosis.

VIDEOCLERK: That'll be ninety-eight dollars.

GEORGE: What ninety-eight dollars?

VIDEOCLERK: That's what I said, ninety-eight dollars.

GEORGE: How could that piece of crap cost ninety-eight dollars!?

SUSAN: George.

GEORGE: Can you believe this! Ninety-eight dollars!



GEORGE: Do you have any cash?

SUSAN: I guess.

GEORGE: I need like thirty-five, thanks.



GEORGE: So, was it me?

SUSAN: Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? Here.

GEORGE: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.

SUSAN: Yeah, sure. I gotta go.

GEORGE: Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?

SUSAN: You're an idiot.

GEORGE: Why? That's, that's a legitimate sociological question.

SUSAN: I'll see you. And George, by the way... you stink real bad.

GEORGE: It's not me! It's the car!

 




MONA: I didn't think I'd come.

KRAMER: I knew you would.

MONA: Oh Kramer!






CARWASHER: We'll give it the full executive treatment, it includes a complete de-ionization of the vehicle. We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionize, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionizing machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the uh, Jasmine or the Potpourri.

JERRY: Let's do it.

 


HAIRDRESSER: The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapor machine and then a heated cap. Then we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar, two parts vinegar, ten parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.

ELAINE: Tomato Sauce?






CARWASHER: Thanks a lot.



JERRY: Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!








CARL: It still smells.




JERRY: It still smells!

GEORGE: How could it still smell after all that?

JERRY: I don't know!

GEORGE: Well, what are you gonna do?

JERRY: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!

GEORGE: You're selling the car!?

JERRY: You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even Superman would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.

GEORGE: Maybe I'll buy it.

JERRY: Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This isn't just an odor, you'd need a priest to get rid of this thing!



ELAINE: I still smell!

JERRY: You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!

GEORGE: Alright, let me smell you.



SUSAN: Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!

JERRY: Susan!

SUSAN: Kramer!

JERRY: What is going on?

SUSAN: You know what's going on? First he vomits on me. Then he burns down my father's cabin. And now he's taken Mona away from me.

GEORGE: He stole your girlfriend?

SUSAN: Yes. She's in love with him.

GEORGE: Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings them back.





JERRY: Hello?

KRAMER: She still there?

JERRY: No she left. What is going on? What did you do?

KRAMER: I didn't do anything.



KRAMER: I was in the video store and I was practicing my golf swing, you know, with a broom and...



KRAMER: But she saw me take a swing and told me that the club is going back to fast. Well we started talking. She's a golf teacher! So I went to a lesson and, you know, something happened between us but she's a golf teacher Jerry! I've struck gold! She's taken six strokes off my game.

JERRY: That's the least of what you've accomplished.

KRAMER: Listen, I'm going to have dinner with her tonight. Is it alright if I borrow your jacket?

JERRY: Ah, sure

ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has never been with a man her entire life.

KRAMER: I'm Kramer.

 


GEORGE: I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?

SUSAN: I just don't know what she sees in Kramer.

GEORGE: Listen. You're beautiful, you're intelligent, you'll meet other girls.

SUSAN: You think so?

GEORGE: Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.

SUSAN: You're very sweet.

GEORGE: Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell you, ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.

SUSAN: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, you're just so... hip.



GEORGE: Oh my God.

SUSAN: What?

GEORGE: It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.



ALLISON: George?

GEORGE: Allison! Hi! Oh my God! How are you?

ALLISON: Good. You know you owe me fifty dollars.

GEORGE: Right. I, I don't have it on me. Allison this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

ALLISON: Nice to meet you.

SUSAN: Nice to meet you.

ALLISON: That's a beautiful vest.

SUSAN: Thank you.






KRAMER: I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment, it was very romantic. You know with that fake wood wallpaper there the atmosphere is fabulous in there now. It's like a ski lodge.

CARSALESMAN: What year did you say this was?

JERRY: Ninety.

KRAMER: Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving, she's got to get up early.

JERRY: That's strange.

CARSALESMAN: How many miles you got on this thing?

JERRY: Twenty-three thousand.

KRAMER: And I was looking good, too. I had a nice new shirt on, I'm wearing your jacket.

JERRY: Wait a second... my jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!



CARSALESMAN: I can't sell this car.

JERRY: This... thing... has got to be stopped!




HAIRDRESSER: So, what do you want to do?

ELAINE: Sauce me.









JERRY: Why do we need B O? What is the function of it? Everything in nature has a reason, has a purpose, except B O. Doesn't make any sense, do something good, hard work, exercise, smell very bad. This is the way the human being is designed. You move, you stink. Why can't our bodies help us? Why can't sweat smell good? It'd be a different world, wouldn't it? Instead of putting your laundry in the hamper, you'd put it in a vase. You'd go down to the drugstore and pick up some deodorant and perspirant. You'd probably have a dirty sweat sock hanging from the rear view mirror of your car. And then on a really special night, maybe a little underwear coming out of your breast pocket. Just to let her know she's important.
