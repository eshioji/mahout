

JERRY: So I move into the center lane, now I get ahead of this woman, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So she pulls up along side of me, gives me... the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person.



JERRY: It's a finger, what, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't you? I would feel worse if I got the toe than if I got the finger. Because it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and uh...



JERRY: "Look at that toe, buddy."



JERRY: I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe, isn't it?




JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane.



JERRY: That's it. Done!

ELAINE: That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.

JERRY: I am... the master packer.

ELAINE: Yeah right, you're the master packer.

JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine...



JERRY: Packing is no different than leading men into battle. You've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses...



JERRY: ...of every soldier in that platoon, from a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.

ELAINE: Excuse me, master packer?

JERRY: Yes?

ELAINE: Just give me your keys.

JERRY: Alright, sir.



JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Yeah.



ELAINE: Okay, so now is there anything else I need to know about this place?

JERRY: Uh yeah, the hot water takes a little while to come on. So the best thing to do is turn it on, do all your shopping, come back and take a shower.

ELAINE: Okay, this is quite a place.

JERRY: There's more, the refrigerator.



JERRY: Deduct a minimum of two days of all expiration dates.



JERRY: No meat, no leftovers, no butter.



JERRY: And I cannot overstate this, no soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?

ELAINE: I'll eat out.

JERRY: One more thing, Benes. Regarding sexual activity, strictly prohibited but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favor, do it in the tub.



GEORGE: Ready?

JERRY: Yeah, one sec.



GEORGE: Hey Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: You coming to the airport with us?

ELAINE: No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a break from my roommate.

GEORGE: Oh, the actress waitress.

ELAINE: No, the waitress actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of a chorus line. So now all day long she's walking around the apartment singing, "God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it." Ah, she's gonna get it right in her...

GEORGE: Why don't you just kick her out?

ELAINE: She's on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, well... a little rough finding something good in your price range.  Hey, but you my friend may be in luck.

JERRY: I'm not looking.

GEORGE: No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!

JERRY: Yeah, what's it like?

GEORGE: I haven't seen it yet, but it's a two bedroom, it's on uh, the West Eighty-Third, about a half block from the park?

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: About twice what you're paying here but it's a great building, its two bedrooms!

JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one.



JERRY: I saw that.

ELAINE: You ought to at least take a look at it.

JERRY: Really? Why?

ELAINE: Because then I could move in here.

JERRY: Ah, I know why you're saying that.

ELAINE: It's time you got out a here anyway.

GEORGE: Yeah, tell him, but quickly, I'm double parked here.

ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can't have soft cheese...

GEORGE: Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on here for ten years, no human can turn this off.

ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you're doing okay now, you should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live like this.

JERRY: Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.

ELAINE: Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from Iceland to Finland.

GEORGE: Jerry, what do you... you wanna... you wanna see the place or not?

JERRY: I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.




JERRY: Elaine!



JERRY: Elaine!

ELAINE: Jerry!



ELAINE: Jerry, oh hi. Welcome back. How were the shows?

JERRY: Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR!?



JERRY: What!?

ELAINE: They were stolen.

JERRY: Stolen!? When?

ELAINE: A couple of hours ago, the police are coming right over.

JERRY: Stolen!?



ELAINE: Someone left the door open.



KRAMER: Oh yeah.

JERRY: You left the door open?!

KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cooking and I, I, you know came in to get this spatula... and I left the door open because I was gonna bring the spatula right back!

JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?

KRAMER: The door.

JERRY: The door? You left the door open?

KRAMER: Yeah well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.

JERRY: Yeah, and?

KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera... The Bold and the Beautiful.

JERRY: So the door was wide open?

KRAMER: Wide open!



ELAINE: Excuse me.

JERRY: And where were you?

ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale's... waiting for the shower to heat up.

KRAMER: Look Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm, you have insurance, right buddy?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: How can you not have insurance?

JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapdo D Twenty-Nine. It's the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door...



JERRY: ...must be closed!

KRAMER: Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it, I'm on the case buddy, I'm on the case!

JERRY: Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an accident.

KRAMER: I made a mistake.

ELAINE: These things happen.

KRAMER: I'm human

JERRY: In your way.




POLICEMAN: Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer. Is that about it?

ELAINE: Answering machine.

JERRY: Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.

POLICEMAN: What do you mean?

JERRY: It's a joke.

POLICEMAN: I see. Well, Mr. Seinfeld uh, we'll look into it and uh, we'll let you know if we, you know if we find anything.

JERRY: You ever find anything?

POLICEMAN: No.



JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.

POLICEMAN: You bet.



ELAINE: I didn't get that joke either.

JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him. He's the crook. Why would he answer?



JERRY: How did you get in here?



GEORGE: I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.

JERRY: Again?

GEORGE: I don't know how you put up with this.

ELAINE: Yeah, tell him George.

JERRY: You would still wanna move in here?

ELAINE: Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel Merman without the talent.

JERRY: Is that uh, other apartment still available?






JERRY: I got ripped off for about the... eighteenth time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, "Call the police. You really should call the police." So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, "Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I'm gonna see some real action." Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out the report. They give you your copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do you? It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. "Did you lose a Sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, he's dressed like a penguin! We can find him, he's a penguin!"




ELAINE: Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oh, a fireplace! Are you kidding me! Does this work?



GEORGE: I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.

JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here?

ELAINE: They deliver it.

JERRY: They deliver wood?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: What do you tip a wood guy?



GEORGE: I didn't know there was a fireplace.

ELAINE: Look! Look at, look at this! There's a garden.

GEORGE: A garden? I can't believe there's a garden!

JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can get a gardener.

JERRY: You tip him?

ELAINE: You can.

GEORGE: You don't tip a gardener!

ELAINE: You can tip a gardener.

GEORGE: You don't need a gardener.

ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

JERRY: They deliver the coal?

ELAINE: Sure, it's... probably the same guy who delivers the
wood.

JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.

ELAINE: Oh man, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!

JERRY: I don't have any plants.

GEORGE: I have plants.

ELAINE: Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking in it!



ELAINE: It's a walk-in. Can you believe it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?!



JERRY: I like that.



JERRY: What do you think, George?

GEORGE: It's your decision.



JERRY: I'm taking it, I'm taking the place, I'm gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place, I'm living here. I'm moving.

ELAINE: Youï¿½re moving? That means I'm moving.



ELAINE: Oh gee is that incredible?



GEORGE: Congratulations.




ELAINE: What about the couch?

JERRY: You like the couch? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: You're moving in, you're a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me... a hundred and fifty dollars.



JERRY: In fact, get it out of here right now, take it out the door, I don't even wanna see it, go, get it out.

ELAINE: A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?

JERRY: Yeah!

ELAINE: For this couch?!

JERRY: Okay, you tell me, what is it worth?

ELAINE: Okay, uh... I'll tell you what. I could go as high as uh...



ELAINE: I don't know, maybe... twenty dollars?



JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's George.

JERRY: Come on up.



JERRY: Oh alright, forget it, I'm gonna take it with me then.



JERRY: I'm just gonna pack up the cushions right now.

ELAINE: Okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.

JERRY: You wanna get the other end because I wanna get it in the hall.



ELAINE: Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars. Is that alright?

JERRY: Fifty dollars?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

JERRY: Thank you very much.

ELAINE: Thank you very much.



GEORGE: Hey, what's going on?

ELAINE: I just bought Jerry's couch for fifty dollars.

JERRY: So did you bring the lease?



JERRY: Alright, gee, three years, that kind of seems like a long time.

GEORGE: Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry. Listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want it, don't worry about it because uh, you know I, I... I could take it.

JERRY: You could take it? You want it?

GEORGE: No, I don't want it. I want it if you don't want it.

JERRY: So you do want it?

GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don't want it!

JERRY: You just said you wanted it!

GEORGE: No, I'm saying if a situation arose in which you didn't want it I might take it.



JERRY: So take it.

GEORGE: How can I take it?!

JERRY: How can I take it?

GEORGE: It's your apartment!

JERRY: How can I want it now if you want it?

ELAINE: Excuse me uh, I don't mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it can I take your place?

GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.

JERRY: I... am not taking it.



ELAINE: Well one of you better damn well take it!

JERRY: Well what do you wanna do here?

GEORGE: I, I don't know.

JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?

GEORGE: Who flips? You flip, I'll call.

JERRY: Okay, fine.



JERRY: This is the official flip! No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that's it, agreed?

GEORGE: I'm good.

ELAINE: I don't know who to root for, George's place has carpeting.

JERRY: Alright, now you call it in the air.

GEORGE: No catching.

JERRY: No no.

GEORGE: Flip it.



GEORGE: Heads!



JERRY: Tails!

GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: Interference! You can't count that! Come on, are you crazy! The coin can not touch anything, it affects it.

JERRY: You didn't call no interference!

GEORGE: You don't have to call that. That's a rule!

JERRY: I don't believe this.

GEORGE: Oh oh oh, alright, fine Jerry, you win! Take it, just take it!

JERRY: I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?

ELAINE: I'd better not.

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what. I'll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes, that's it, you gotta win three.

GEORGE: Okay.



GEORGE: Okay, I'll choose you.



GEORGE: What do you want?

JERRY: Odds.



GEORGE: I want evens.



JERRY: Good.

GEORGE: You got odds.

JERRY: You got evens.

GEORGE: Right, ready.

JERRY: For the apartment.



JERRY: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

JERRY: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!





JERRY: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Mine!

JERRY: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Once, twice, three, shoot!



GEORGE:  Congratulations... congratulations.

JERRY: Thanks.



GEORGE: Why did I put up two?! Why did I put up two?!





KRAMER: Jerry, I think I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: The last couple a days he's been acting very strange. I think he's avoiding me.

JERRY: Hard to imagine.

KRAMER: Yeah! And get this. I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I... this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this. I went, "Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff."

JERRY: Right.

KRAMER: You know, very casually, so that he was gonna take me in to his confidence.

ELAINE: So what did he say?

KRAMER: "What stuff?"

JERRY: Oh. Case closed!

KRAMER: No, you don't understand. You see he swallowed see, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna borrow some tea. If I don't get back in five minutes maybe you'd better call the police.

JERRY: Okay, starting...



JERRY: Now!

KRAMER: Yeah!






GEORGE: I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don't know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. I don't know if it's the tile or the lighting. I feel like Robert Wagner.

JERRY: It's a good mirror.



JERRY: So, what are you getting?

GEORGE: I don't know, what can you eat? You, you can't have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out, coffee out, french fries out, BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents, three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sitting there with a carrot! They're closing in on a hundred, I'm saying to them, "How can you eat that stuff?!" 



GEORGE: I'm so sick about losing that choose, you don't know.

JERRY: Oh right, forget it, forget it, I'm not taking the place!

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: How can I live there?

GEORGE: Why not?!

JERRY: Look at you, you're still thinking about it, I'll never feel comfortable.

GEORGE: Oh, get out a here.

JERRY: How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping.

GEORGE: Mope?

JERRY: You're already moping! Would you take the place?

GEORGE: No, impossible! It's your apartment.

JERRY: You found the place.

GEORGE: You won the choose.

JERRY: Alright, forget it, it's over, I'm not moving.

GEORGE: Well, me neither.

JERRY: Definitely?

GEORGE: Definitely.

JERRY: Oh, then just get rid of it. You won't have any problem.

GEORGE: No, it's not a problem. I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.



WAITRESS: What apartment?

GEORGE: Oh, it's a great place. It's uh, two-bedroom uh, West Eighty-Third, about half block from the park.

WAITRESS: What's the rent? 




GEORGE: I don't know, what we're doing here, this is ridiculous.

JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.

ELAINE: I can't believe I lost the deposit on that U-haul. And I threw out my couch.



JERRY: If only the coin hadn't hit the table.

GEORGE: The table is interference, you know it!

JERRY: It is not!

GEORGE: It is too!

ELAINE: Well my roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel.

WAITRESS: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi, Carol.

WAITRESS: I just wanted to introduce you to my husband. This is Larry.



WAITRESS: This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.

LARRY: You don't know how grateful I am. If there's anything I can ever do to repay you. I, I mean, we're just so thrilled with this place.

WAITRESS: It's a dream.

LARRY: I'm running in the park now, I've lost weight, we're barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.

GEORGE: We're really glad for you.

ELAINE: Couldn't be happier.

JERRY: It's wonderful.

WAITRESS: Diane, Diane, come here. This is my new next door neighbor, Diane.



WAITRESS: These are the guys who turned this place down, can you believe it? Diane gave me the greatest backrub today, she's a masseuse!

DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it's such a great location and it's so close to the park.

GEORGE: We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes.

DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.



GEORGE: Nice meeting you.



JERRY: How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smashing it over my head.



FIRSTMANATPARTY: I get a call from Gilmore this morning and get this, they're restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I gotta be there on the first of the month.

SECONDMANATPARTY: Really? What are you gonna do about the apartment?

FIRSTMANATPARTY: Well, what can I do? Give it up.



JERRY: What's the rent?

GEORGE: What's the rent?

ELAINE: What's the rent?




JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements... and those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, "I got the front seat" "I wanted the front seat!" "I called it". And the other kid knows he's got nothing to say, "He called it, what can I do?" If there was a "kid court of law" it holds up, "Your Honor, my client did ask for the front seat". And the judge would go, "Did he call it?" "Well no, he didn't call..." Bang! "He has to call it, case closed, objection overruled".
