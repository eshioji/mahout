

JERRY: You know, I tell you, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood dor a lot of reasons. And I'll tell you reason number one. As an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? Yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite... cookies." So what if you ruin it. See, because as an adult we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!








TVVOICE: Look, Sigmund! Look at the sky! The planets are on fire! It is just as you prophesied! The planets of our solar system incinerating! Like flaming globes, Sigmund! Like flaming globes!



TVVOICE: Sigmund.











ELAINE: What do you got, a cucumber?

GEORGE: Yeah, so what?

ELAINE: You're bringing in an outside cucumber?

GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.



JERRY: What have I done? I can't read this! Fulman, Hertabomb... I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.



JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is, is that a joke?

ELAINE: No. Let me see that.



ELAINE: "Don't mess with Johnny."

JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?

ELAINE: Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

GEORGE: Let me see that.



ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer?

JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"

GEORGE: I think I'm having a heart attack.

JERRY: I don't think that's it.

GEORGE: I'm not kidding.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.

JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.

GEORGE: Tightness...

JERRY: Come on.

GEORGE: Shortness of breath...

JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.

GEORGE: Radiating waves of pain.

JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.  I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.

GEORGE: There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm, left arm.



JERRY: He saw that show on anorexia last year, ate like an animal for two weeks.

GEORGE: Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.

JERRY: So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?

GEORGE: Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.

JERRY: I'll call an ambulance.





WAITRESS: Is everything alright?

GEORGE: We'll just take a check.



GEORGE: You made a mistake on the...

ELAINE: George!








MANINHOSPITAL: Ah...

GEORGE: Are you okay?

MANINHOSPITAL: Oh...

GEORGE: I'm George, George Costanza. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that...

MANINHOSPITAL: Shut up!



JERRY: Well? What do you think?

NURSE: "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.

JERRY: "Salami, salami, bologna?"

DOCTOR: Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in in a few minutes.

JERRY: What a surprise.



JERRY: Hey, how you doing buddy? You need anything? You want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?

GEORGE: No, no thanks.

JERRY: You know, I was wondering. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?

GEORGE: Oh sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.

JERRY: Well, you know I was thinking, if things don't exactly... work out.

GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.

JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all...

JERRY: Well, you know.

GEORGE: Well, okay.

JERRY: Oh, and do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?

GEORGE: Susan Davis? Hey, wait a second...

JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.

GEORGE: I don't know, you and Susan Davis?

JERRY: You know if your future was a little more certain.

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life. What do I care? I'm finished. It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with, be a pal. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.



JERRY: Well ah, what? Kind of like this?



GEORGE: What are you doing?! Jerry! No! Jerry! What are you, crazy?!



ELAINE: Jerry!



JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing here?



GEORGE: Jerk off.



JERRY: There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.



ELAINE: Hi, George. How you feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?



GEORGE: I'll tell you, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.



GEORGE: Hey, is anybody listening?!



DOCTOR: Uh, hello. Mr. Costanza.

GEORGE: Uh, uh yeah. You know doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.

GEORGE: Oh God, mommy.

DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.

GEORGE: I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you! Thank you, doctor! I don't know how to thank you.

JERRY: Hey, that was really fun George. Can we go home now?

DOCTOR: No, actually we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.

GEORGE: Oh sure, sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.

DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.

GEORGE: What? What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupus?! Is it Lupus?!

DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?

GEORGE: My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.

DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.

GEORGE: Really?

DOCTOR: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh, whose tonsils grow back?



DOCTOR: No, it happens.

JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.

ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anybody who didn't have their tonsils.

DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because no one in my family has their tonsils and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.



JERRY: Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.

GEORGE: Excuse me.

DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.

GEORGE: What? You mean with a knife?

DOCTOR: Yes, with a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up you can have some ice cream.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.

DOCTOR: Think about it.



DOCTOR: Excuse me.

ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry.



ELAINE: I just... have to ask that doctor one more question.



JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!



KRAMER: So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? They gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.

JERRY: Kramer.

KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping...



KRAMER: ...and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.

JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.

KRAMER: No? That's good.

GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out.

KRAMER: Oh man! No! George, we gotta get you out of here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill you in here.

JERRY: It's routine surgery.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Sacamano, he came in here for a hernia operation. Oh yeah, routine surgery. Now he's sitting around in a chair by a window going...



KRAMER: "My name is Bob." George, whatever you do, don't let them cut you. Don't let them cut you.

GEORGE: What should I do, Kramer?

JERRY: Well, for one thing, don't listen to him.

KRAMER: I'll tell you what you do. I'll tell you what you do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a, he's a herbalist, a healer George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function, body and mind.

JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?

KRAMER: No no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.

JERRY: A rebel?

KRAMER: Mmm hmm.

JERRY: No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital with a doctor.

KRAMER: He's holistic. George, he's holistic.

GEORGE: Holistic, that sounds right.

JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.

GEORGE: Let me ask you something. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?

JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I don't know, four grand.

GEORGE: Uh huh. And how much does the healer charge?

KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, holistic, that's what I need. That's the answer.






GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into coming down here?

JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine. I still think you're nuts, though.

GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.

JERRY: I've never had a really good pickle.

GEORGE: Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?



TOR: Would you not put your foot on that please?

JERRY: Sorry.



TOR: What month were you born?

GEORGE: April.

TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well advised to wait.

GEORGE: Really?

TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower?

GEORGE: Yes.

TOR: Stop using it.

GEORGE: Okay.

KRAMER: I'm off hot water.

TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.

GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.



TOR: I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.

GEORGE: Can I use hot water on my face?

TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.

JERRY: And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.

GEORGE: What about shaving?

TOR: You're eating too much dairy. May I?



GEORGE: I guess so.



TOR: You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis is, in Chinese medical terms, an invasion of heat and wind.

JERRY: There's some hot air blowing in here.

TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.

GEORGE: Could it be lukewarm?

JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?




DOCTOR: The tongue, yes the tongue, or in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ. Consists of two parts, the body, and the root. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile.



ELAINE: Uh huh.






TOR: Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.

JERRY: I love crampbark.

TOR: Cleavers.

JERRY: Cleaver. I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.

TOR: And some couchgrass.

JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.



KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if...



TOR:  Oh, yes, yes. Mmm hmm. "Cleveland one seventeen, San Antonio one oh nine.



KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it.



GEORGE: Hey, it's not too bad.








GEORGE: I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!

AMBULANCEDRIVER: I didn't take your Chuckle, man!

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: I had five Chuckles. I ate the green one and the yellow one and the red one is missing!

AMBULANCEDRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles!

JERRY: Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.

GEORGE: My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!

JERRY: I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: Pull over!

AMBULANCEDRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: Yeah!

JERRY: You're gonna fight?

GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant!

KRAMER: Hey, let me drive!

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: Come on, man. Pull over!

AMBULANCEDRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!



JERRY: Really, gentlemen, please.

GEORGE: My heart! My heart! Where you going? Are you crazy?!

AMBULANCEASSISTANT: I'm gonna kick his ass.

KRAMER: Hey, you have keys?

GEORGE: You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!



JERRY: All this for a Chuckle.

KRAMER: What's a Chuckle?

JERRY: It's a jelly candy. It comes in five flavors.






DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.

ELAINE: Can you let go of my tongue now?

DOCTOR: What?

ELAINE: Let go of my tongue.



DOCTOR: Oh, sorry.

ELAINE: Well, I should uh, get going.



ELAINE: What are you doing?

DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.

ELAINE: A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? I don't think so.








JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.

AMBULANCEDRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.

KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance?

AMBULANCEDRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!

KRAMER: Hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!

AMBULANCEDRIVER: Hey man, you want some of what he got?!

JERRY: Watch out!

KRAMER: Watch out!








JERRY: How you doing? Can't talk?



JERRY: Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?



JERRY: I like that.



JERRY: So how's life without tonsils?



JERRY: What? What's that? So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?



JERRY: Well, live and learn. At least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman. He feels all better already.



JERRY: What are you doing?



ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue. Here, I brought you something.



ELAINE: Oh please, come on, it was nothing.

JERRY: Hey, check out the TV.





TVVOICE: It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.





JERRY: That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmund! That's my note! that's what I thought was so funny! That's not funny. There's nothing funny about that.

MANINHOSPITAL: Shut up!



MANINHOSPITAL: Ah! Ow!




JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick, never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well no matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great, like being on the respirator, intravenous heart lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big."



JERRY: "But I gave myself one of these. Clear!"



JERRY: "And it's gone!"
