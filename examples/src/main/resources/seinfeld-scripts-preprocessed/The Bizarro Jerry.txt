

JERRY: Alright, how about this one. Let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE: Fine.

JERRY: They haul you aboard the mothership, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo or their circus?

GEORGE: I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE: I'm wearing a little hat, I'm jumping through fire. They're putting their little alien heads in my mouth.

JERRY: At least its show business.

GEORGE: But in the zoo, you know, they might put a woman in there with me to uh, you know, get me to mate.

JERRY: What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE: Then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

 


KRAMER: George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE: Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER: What?

JERRY: He knows.

GEORGE: On the left, exquisite marble! High ceilings. And a flush like a jet engine! 


GEORGE: Ha ha!

KRAMER: Now listen, uh, you better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE: You sure?

JERRY: He knows.



GEORGE: Wow. Nice.

JERRY: Why don't you try your engagement story?



GEORGE: Won't work.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GEORGE: He knows.




ELAINE: Look Kevin, I really like you. But um, maybe we'd be better off just being... friends.

KEVIN: Friends?

ELAINE: Well. I mean. Oh God, this tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN: Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you and Jerry!

 





COPIERMAN: Damn thing is jammed again.

KRAMER: You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on them. 


WORRIEDMAN: Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

COPIERMAN: Come on, let's go.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah.



 


ELAINE: Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY: I don't know, do you have a...



JERRY: Not bad. What, what does she...

ELAINE: I put her stats on the back.

JERRY: Pretty impressive. Serious boyfriend ninety-two to ninety-five. Owns her own car. Favorite president: James Polk!

GEORGE: Hmm! Let me see that.

JERRY: So how did it go with Kevin? Did you steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE: You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY: Why would anybody want a friend?

ELAINE: Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY: I mean all that stuff is so small... stupid.

GEORGE: You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this was my fiancee

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Don't you see. Women like that are like members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE: Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were getting close and now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city.

GEORGE: Can I keep this?

ELAINE: No, I need it.

GEORGE: Thanks.



 


GEORGE: Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay.

AMANDA: I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here.



GEORGE: Well, let me. Heh. Let me just uh, check and make sure I have the right man, ha! Seems, oh! I, oh!



AMANDA: Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE: Well, if you must know, she was my fiancee, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA: Oh, sorry. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.



GEORGE: I'm George.



WORKINGMAN: Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

WORKINGMAN: Heh heh!

KRAMER: You want a drink? I'm buying.

WORKINGMAN: In that case, make mine a double!






GILLIAN: Jerry?

JERRY: Gillian. Hi.

GILLIAN: Very nice to meet you.

JERRY: It's nice to meet you!






JERRY: She had man hands.

ELAINE: Man hands?

JERRY: The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology. I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE: Would you prefer it if she had no hands at all?

JERRY: Would she have hooks?

ELAINE: Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY: Kind of cool looking.

ELAINE: Uh listen, you're picking me up from my place tomorrow.

JERRY: Yeah yeah.

ELAINE: Okay, I've got five huge boxes of buttons.

JERRY: Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call.

ELAINE: Jerry!




JERRY: Kramer?!

KRAMER: Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY: It's eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is going on?!

KRAMER: Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand-Leland by nine.

JERRY: Why??

KRAMER: Because I'm working there, that's why.

JERRY: How long have I been asleep? What, what year is this?

KRAMER: Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting aimlessly?

JERRY: Now that you mention it.

KRAMER: But I finally realized what's missing in my life. Structure. And at Brand-Leland I'm getting things done. And I love the people I'm working with.

JERRY: How much are they paying you?

KRAMER: Oh, no no no no, I don't want any pay. I'm doing this just for me.

JERRY: Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER: T C B. You know, taking care of business. Ah, I gotta go.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: I'll see you tonight, huh?



KRAMER: Forgot my briefcase.

JERRY: What you got in there?

KRAMER: Crackers.



 


JERRY: So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE: Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY: I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE: Right. Bye.



ELAINE: Where were you today?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Pick. Up.

JERRY: Damn.

ELAINE: So? Where were you?!

JERRY: Uh, here I guess, and uh, I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE: I had to ask Kevin to leave his office and come and pick me up!

JERRY: So? What are friends for?

ELAINE: Yeah! And he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY: So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE: Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is down. Down is up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE: Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY: No. It's still a goodbye.

ELAINE: Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Is he black?

JERRY: Look. Just forget it already. Alright?



KRAMER: Wow man, what a day. Could I use a drink.



JERRY: Tough day at the office?

KRAMER: Just coming in and that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY: Well, we better get going if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER: Yeah well, count me out. I'm swimming. Old man Leland is busting my hump over these reports. If I don't get them done by nine, I'm toast.


 



GEORGE: This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!



MODELONE: Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA: These are my friends. Annabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE: Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA: So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODELTWO: A bore.

GEORGE: You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead fiancee, Susan...



GEORGE: In fact I think I, I may have a picture of her.



MODELTHREE: Wow, she was beautiful. Do you wanna dance?

 




GILLIAN: Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY: No. No thanks, I'm just not hungry.

GILLIAN: Well, then at least drink your beer.



JERRY: Oh. Twist off.

GILLIAN: You have a little something on your face.



JERRY: I can get it.

GILLIAN: Uh, no no, No no. You're missing it, it's higher.





GILLIAN: It's an eyelash. Make a wish.



JERRY: I don't want to.

GILLIAN: Make a wish.

JERRY: Okay.


JERRY: Didn't come true.

GILLIAN: Don't you just love lobster?






KEVIN: That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE: I know, he's so tiny!



KEVIN: Yeah! Hey, hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple of my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we just call "Feldman!"



ELAINE: Bizarro world.

 


GEORGE: Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY: Then it does exist.

GEORGE: Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY: So when are you going out with this girl again?

GEORGE: I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY: So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE: Flame on!

 


GENE: I got it.



KEVIN: No. You got it last time.



GENE: Don't worry about it.

ELAINE: This is unbelievable.

FELDMAN: Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE: Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN: Nah, it's not, it's just not practical.

KEVIN: Well. See you later, Elaine. Feldman and I gotta get down to the library.



ELAINE: What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN: Read!

ELAINE: Hello?

 


JERRY: So uh, Gillian's coming over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

JERRY: Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator and sell tickets.

KRAMER: That's nice.

JERRY: Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER: Well, we're talking now aren't we?

JERRY: I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning...

KRAMER: Oh, here we go.

JERRY: And then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted, we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER: What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time of year?!

JERRY: It's your third day.

KRAMER: I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later.



JERRY: Well.



JERRY: Call if you're gonna be late!



ELAINE: What? What is going on with you two?

JERRY: Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

ELAINE: Alright, listen. Have you seen my address...



ELAINE: Ah! There it is. Okay, I got it. I'll see you later.

JERRY: Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you going? I, I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE: Well I, I guess I been at Reggie's.

JERRY: The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE: Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read.

JERRY: I read.

ELAINE: Books, Jerry.

JERRY: Oh. Big deal.

ELAINE: Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the excruciating minutia of every single daily event.

JERRY: Like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, and the teller gives me this look like...

ELAINE: I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY: The whole system is breaking down!




GEORGE: Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinking, we might just be better of being friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye.



GEORGE: No! No!




GILLIAN: Friends. Just friends.

JERRY: Yeah.

GILLIAN: Yeah. Alright. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY: I wish I could, but we're friends.

GILLIAN: I'm just gonna go wash my hands.

JERRY: Good idea.



JERRY: There's a beach towel on the rack.



JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Jerry! Jerry, my, my hair dryer ruined the picture! And I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY: Who is this?

GEORGE: Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man hands. I'm begging you!

JERRY: If I get it for you will you take me to that club and show me a good time?

GEORGE: Yes! Yes, alright, anything!



JERRY: Got it.



JERRY: Oh!

 


KRAMER: Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY: I'm right here.



JERRY: You're late.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY: Like you care.

KRAMER: The work piled up, I lost track of time.

JERRY: Oh! Sure! Sure! You and your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, and I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way...



JERRY: ...was for two.

KRAMER: You cooked?

JERRY: I ordered in. It's still effort.



KRAMER: Ow! Jeez!

JERRY: What's wrong?

KRAMER: Ow! It's my stomach.

JERRY: You're probably getting an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing us.

KRAMER: You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. What do you say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY: The coffee shop?

KRAMER: You got it, buddy.

JERRY: I'll call George!

 


JERRY: Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE: Maybe she can get me another picture of man hands. Elaine!

JERRY: Elaine!

KRAMER: Elaine!



KEVIN: Hey! Elaine! Hi! Over here!



ELAINE: Jerry, George, Kramer. This is Kevin, Gene, and Feldman.



JERRY: This is really weird.



ELAINE: Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment?

KEVIN: Sure.



ELAINE: Thanks. What, what do you guys want?

GEORGE: Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY: I tried to get him one but man hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!



KEVIN: Here you are.

ELAINE: Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.



GEORGE: Elaine? Can I come?

ELAINE: I'm, I'm sorry. We've already got a George.



 


KRAMER: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND: Kramer, I've been reviewing your work. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER: Well, I ah, been having trouble at home and uh, I mean ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes.

LELAND: No no, I don't think that's going to do it. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, just trying to get ahead.

LELAND: Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER: I don't even really work here!

LELAND: That's what makes this so difficult.

 


GEORGE: Hi. George.

MODELFOUR: Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I used to come here all the time with my fiancee back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture.



MODELFOUR: What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE: Huh?

MODELFOUR: That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did.

GEORGE: Ha! Heh.



BOUNCER: Let's go. Private party.



 


KEVIN: Who is it?

ELAINE: It's Lainey!

KEVIN: Hi Elaine!



ELAINE: Hi. Oh! Oh oh oh oh!

KEVIN: Come on in!

ELAINE: Okay. Hi Gene!



ELAINE: Uh ha!





ELAINE: What's up?

KEVIN: Just reading.



KEVIN: Hey. What're you doing?

ELAINE: Eating olives.

KEVIN: Have you ever heard of asking?



KEVIN: Who is it?

FELDMAN: Feldman. From across the hall.

KEVIN: Hold on.



KEVIN: Hey.

FELDMAN: Hey, Kevin!

KEVIN: Hi.

FELDMAN: Look who I ran into.



VARGAS: Hello, Kevin.

KEVIN: Hello, Vargas.



KEVIN: You want to catch a ballgame this weekend?

VARGAS: Great! I'll see you later!



KEVIN: Okay. Vargas. So?

FELDMAN: I got them.

KEVIN: Alright! Hey Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE: Oh!

KEVIN: Fourth row, center.

ELAINE: Get out!





GENE: What is the matter with you?

ELAINE: Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE: Haven't you done enough already?



ELAINE: It's locked.




JERRY: So this is it, huh?

GEORGE: But it, it was here, I'm telling you it was really here! The, there was a bar and a dance floor.

JERRY: I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? Let's get out of here George.






GENE: At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN: Oh, so what did you do?

GENE: I called the phone company and immediately reported the error.

KEVIN: Nice.



KEVIN: Who is it?

FELDMAN: Feldman. From across the hall.

KEVIN: Hold on.



FELDMAN: Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN: Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN: Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN: You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.



KEVIN: Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
