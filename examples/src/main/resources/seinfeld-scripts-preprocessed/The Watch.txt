JERRY: Here's what happened last week in case you missed it.



JERRY: So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.

HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.

JERRY: We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.



GEORGE: I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.

SUSAN: You, you're passing?

GEORGE: Well, it's... much too low.



JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.



GEORGE: Is that the one your parents gave you?

JERRY: Yeah, but it never works.



HELEN: Where's that watch we bought you?

JERRY: It's at the jeweler.



DAVOLA: I would like somebody to hit me.



HELEN: So what's the matter with this Davola guy?

KRAMER: He's after Jerry now.



MORTY: You know, I never had a back problem until the night I slept on that convertible sofa.





SUSAN: Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.





GEORGE: Here you go.

KRAMER: Cubans?

GEORGE: Yeah, Cuban cigars.







MORTY: Ah!

NURSE: What's wrong?

MORTY: The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. That tearing sound.



Now listen to me, I'm negotiating. Negotiation. This is what you do in business.



MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?

NURSE: Leave it.



JERRY: Tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?

ELAINE: He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.

GEORGE: Tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of this thing.



ELAINE: His name is... Kramer.

DRRESTON: I want you to tell this young man to give me a call.





MORTY: My wallets gone! My wallets gone!



HELEN: Where did you get that watch?

UNCLELEO: I found it in a garbage can. What kind of an idiot throws away a perfectly good watch!?




JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie, and stress organizer, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?






MORTY: I don't understand this jeweler, Jimmy Sherman. He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.

JERRY: Oh, you know these jewelers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries wrapped in a riddle.



HELEN: She's very attractive.

JERRY: She's okay.

HELEN: Just okay?

JERRY: She's nice.

HELEN: She's better than nice.

JERRY: She's alright.

HELEN: She's beautiful.

JERRY: She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I think she's beautiful.

JERRY: So you ask her out.

HELEN: I'm not gonna ask her out.

JERRY: Why not?

HELEN: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.

JERRY: She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

HELEN: I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.

JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.

UNCLELEO: She's alright.

MORTY: Two exact same watches. He tells you a week and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.




GEORGE: He said what?

SUSAN: "The hell with them."

GEORGE: "The hell with them?"

SUSAN: Those were his exact words.

GEORGE: Oh boy.

SUSAN: He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys who have no idea and no experience more money?"

GEORGE: He was pretty emphatic?

SUSAN: Pounded on his desk.

GEORGE: Pounded?



SUSAN: I told you to take the offer.

GEORGE: Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.

SUSAN: You said it was insulting.

GEORGE: I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.

SUSAN: Well, there's nothing I can do.

GEORGE: Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?

SUSAN: Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.

GEORGE: Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?

SUSAN: You'll have to wait till Monday.

GEORGE: Monday? No no, I can't wait till Monday, that's impossible. I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?



SUSAN: I can't give you his address.



SUSAN: Give it back!

GEORGE: Give me the purse!






ELAINE: Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Okay.

KRAMER: Have we been intimate?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

KRAMER: And how often do we do it?

ELAINE: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?

KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. We do it, uh... five times a week, okay?

KRAMER: Oh, baby.



ELAINE: Oh my God. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?

KRAMER: I know what I'm gonna say.

ELAINE: No no, but I would like to hear it.

KRAMER: No no, I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. Okay, go ahead, do it.



ELAINE: Alright, okay. You talk to him.

KRAMER: Talk to him.

ELAINE: Hey, how's your hair?

KRAMER: Oh well, yeah, it's good.



ELAINE: You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.

KRAMER: Uh yes. Uh uh, doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.

ELAINE: Okay.



KRAMER: Johnny... was a rebel. He rode through the land...



KRAMER: Yeah uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston? Um well, hello there. Ah yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.

ELAINE: No no, not friends.

KRAMER: Well actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends. Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends.



KRAMER: And uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine.



KRAMER: And uh, she's very much in love with me and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.



ELAINE: That's perfect.

KRAMER: If not, I can assure you, doctor that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.



KRAMER: Yes. Yeah, but the point that I...



KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible.



KRAMER: Well, I suppose I could but I'd have to shift a few things around, um... hold on for a second will you? Uh...



KRAMER: Uh, go ahead, yeah. Alright uh... yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. Uh, ha, okay. So long.



ELAINE: What happened? What'd he say? What's going on here?

KRAMER: Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.

ELAINE: Get together!!

KRAMER: He wants to talk.

ELAINE: Well, why didn't you say no!!

KRAMER: What? Uh... That's interesting.



ELAINE: Ugh!






NAOMI: Did you enjoy your Poisson?

HELEN: It was... different.

NAOMI: And how was yours?

JERRY: Ah, very good.

NAOMI: You should try our mousse. It'll change your life expectancy.

JERRY: No thanks, just the check.



HELEN: What's the matter with you?

JERRY: What?

HELEN: Why didn't you flirt with her?

JERRY: Come on.

HELEN: She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?

JERRY: What am I gonna say?

HELEN: You just sat there.

JERRY: Well, you made me uncomfortable.

HELEN: You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?

UNCLELEO: Where's the bathroom?

JERRY: In the back, on your right.



JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.

HELEN: Jerry.

JERRY: Will you let me pay just once.

MORTY: You're out of your mind.

JERRY: How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!

MORTY: Don't worry about it.

JERRY: What're you gonna do?

MORTY: What's the difference, we'll figure something out.

HELEN: You're not paying.



JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. Because if this works, the whole monetary system is obsolete, we're back to wampum. I'm going to the bathroom.



MORTY: How the hell am I gonna pay for this?






UNCLELEO: They give you some portion here, huh?

JERRY: Uh, yeah. Hey Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.

UNCLELEO: Aw no no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in show business. I know you're all very busy.

JERRY: So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?

UNCLELEO: Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.

JERRY: Oh, huh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

UNCLELEO: Well, I haven't seen too many like these.



JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one?

UNCLELEO: Aw sure.





JERRY: Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.






RUSSELSDOORMAN: There's a George Bonanza to see you.

GEORGE: Costanza. Costanza.

RUSSELSDOORMAN: George Costanza.

GEORGE: The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing.



GEORGE: Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Seinfeld friend.



RUSSELSDOORMAN: He says call him Monday.



GEORGE: Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: It's about the show. It... no, it was...

RUSSELSDOORMAN: Excuse me.

GEORGE: It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time.



GEORGE: Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.



RUSSELSDOORMAN: Very good, sir.








MORTY: You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.

MAITRED: Why don't you just let him pay and then you can pay him back?

MORTY: No no, he won't let me do that.

MAITRED: Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?

MORTY: He could wash them.

MAITRED: Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.

MORTY: Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!

MAITRED: Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?

MORTY: You don't understand my...

MAITRED: Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.






ELAINE: Now look, don't take too long.

KRAMER: Look at this building. What is this?

ELAINE: I don't know. It's a building.

KRAMER: The door's on a diagonal.

ELAINE: So what?

KRAMER: It's architecturally incorrect.

ELAINE: Just go.








GEORGE: Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

RUSSELL: We were about to sit down to dinner.



RUSSELL: This is Cynthia.

GEORGE: Oh. Oh hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. 


GEORGE: What're you having, veal?

RUSSELL: No.

GEORGE: Looks like veal.

RUSSELL: It's not veal.

GEORGE: Well, it's a good looking piece of meat.



GEORGE: Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken.



RUSSELL: Who gave you my address?

GEORGE: Now that's a fair question. It is, um... Jerry, yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine. He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.



GEORGE: He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.



GEORGE: Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously the guy has his problems.

RUSSELL: So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?



GEORGE: Well, you know, it's really very funny because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. You know, I, I misinterpreted.

CYNTHIA: Russell, where's the TV Guide?

GEORGE: Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny program...

RUSSELL: Blossom's on Monday.

GEORGE: Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC.



RUSSELL: Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.

GEORGE: Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?  Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand and I never came up here, we never talked, alright? You take good care.



GEORGE: It was nice seeing you again and nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?



RUSSELL: Alright, now look, these deals are already made.



GEORGE: Alright, let me just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.



RUSSELL: Mister Costanza.



GEORGE: Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...



CYNTHIA: Russell, can we eat?

RUSSELL: Alright. Eight thousand.

GEORGE: You've made Jerry very happy.



GEORGE: May I just use your bathroom for a moment?






JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!

UNCLELEO: Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.

JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!

UNCLELEO: I've never seen a band like this.

JERRY: Alright. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!

UNCLELEO: You have it on you?

JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.



JERRY: This is unbelievable.



MORTY: What the hell is going on here?






KRAMER: Well, it uh, it's a pleasure to meet you.



DRRESTON: Thank you for coming in.

KRAMER: Thank you.

DRRESTON: Please, sit down.



KRAMER: Okay.



DRRESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Um, coffee? Anything?

KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, do you have a uh, decaf cappuccino?

DRRESTON: I don't think we have that.

KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.

DRRESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink.

DRRESTON: This is an office.

KRAMER: That's true. But you know, I can't help but think that uh...

DRRESTON: So tell me Mister Kramer...

KRAMER: ...Okay, yes, shoot.

DRRESTON: Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.

KRAMER: Oh, alrighty uh...



KRAMER: Well, what we have here doctor is um, an extraordinary situation.

DRRESTON: Is it?

KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it.






DAVOLA: ...Traveling along...



ELAINE: ...singing a song, side by side...



ELAINE: Wow. You really have a terrible voice.

DAVOLA: Do I know you?

ELAINE: Uh, I don't think so.

DAVOLA: Because you really look familiar.

ELAINE: Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on um, Mount Rushmore.

DAVOLA: Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.

DAVOLA: Oh really.

ELAINE: Um, trustbuster, bust this.








KRAMER: You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. You are absolutely right.

DRRESTON: I'm glad we agree.

KRAMER: Hey, would you like a cigar? You know, they're Cubans.

DRRESTON: I'd love one.



KRAMER: Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.



DRRESTON: If you ever feel a need to talk to someone...



KRAMER: Uh huh.

DRRESTON: ...about anything you have my number.



KRAMER: Well that's very kind of you.



KRAMER: Mmm, these are good, huh?



KRAMER: Oh.








ELAINE: I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?

DAVOLA: No, I don't think so.








JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.

NAOMI: Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.

JERRY: Oh, really? You don't seem that desperate.

NAOMI: Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?

NAOMI: Why?

JERRY: They eat fish.













KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: What happened? What took you so long?

KRAMER: Hey, he's a terrific guy.

ELAINE: What? What are you talking about? What'd he say?

KRAMER: Well, we talked about a lot of things.



ELAINE: You talked about a lot of things? Well...

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Did you talk about us?



DAVOLA: I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her name's Elaine. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

DRRESTON: Did you say Elaine?




JERRY: How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? What, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh no, another head case!"






MORTY: You should have told me it didn't work.

JERRY: I know, I know.

HELEN: You didn't have to throw it out.

JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.



HELEN: Oh, that must be Leo.

JERRY: I would have taken you to the airport.

HELEN: He has nothing to do.

JERRY: Neither do I. Yeah?

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. It's George.

MORTY: Oh, it's George.

HELEN: What ever happened with NBC and the deal?

JERRY: Ah, George turned it down.

HELEN: He turned it down?

JERRY: Yeah.

HELEN: Why did he do that?

JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.

HELEN: What does Ted Danson have to do with it?

MORTY: Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

JERRY: Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.



GEORGE: Hey.

MORTY: Hey, Georgie boy, how are you?

GEORGE: Hey, Mr. Seinfeld.



GEORGE: Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. How are you?



HELEN: What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: What'd I do?

JERRY: What about NBC? Did you hear anything?

GEORGE: Yeah, as a matter of fact I did.



GEORGE: We got a deal.



JERRY: Hey that's wonderful, we got a deal!

MORTY: You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George?



GEORGE: Uh, please, Morty.

MORTY: No no no, he knows how to talk to these people. No one's gonna take advantage of Georgie.



GEORGE: I'm just happy to be working with your talented son.

JERRY: Aw.

GEORGE: Who's not doing this for the money.

JERRY: Come on.

GEORGE: You have no idea how refreshing that is.

JERRY: So what'd we get?

GEORGE: Eight thousand dollars.

JERRY: Beautiful!

GEORGE: That's uh, for the two of us.

HELEN: Four thousand apiece?

JERRY: Let me see if I understand this. In other words, you held out for less money.

GEORGE: I was wrong, you were right.

JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation as I understand it is to get your price to go up.

GEORGE: You're smart, I'm dumb.

JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.



HELEN: That's gotta be Leo.

JERRY: Yeah?

UNCLELEO: Leo.

JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.

MORTY: Alright, let's get going.

JERRY: Dad, before we go I got a little something for you.



JERRY: A present.

MORTY: A present?



MORTY: Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, you see.

JERRY: Come on, you lost your wallet. I figured I'd get you another one.

HELEN: I hope you didn't spend too much on that.

MORTY: I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.

HELEN: He's something, your son, isn't he?

JERRY: Ah hah, alright, let's go.



MORTY: You're a terrific kid.



JERRY: Okay.

GEORGE: Yeah, he's something, isn't he?



HELEN: How could anybody not like you?

GEORGE: You're very special.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.






UNCLELEO: Hey, let's go! It's twelve uh...



UNCLELEO: Twelve twenty-two.

MORTY: Alright, Leo.

JERRY: Hey, Uncle Leo.

UNCLELEO: Hi, hi.

JERRY: How you doing?



JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.

UNCLELEO: Yeah, I hate to give it up.

JERRY: Yeah. Hey dad, you sure you don't need any more money?

MORTY: Jerry!

JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.



HELEN: Bye bye, Jerry.

GEORGE: Bye Mrs. Seinfeld, take care.



MORTY: Bye bye. Thanks again for the wallet.



GEORGE: Morty, always a pleasure.

JERRY: Take care now. So long.



GEORGE: Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.

JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.

GEORGE: You're kidding.

JERRY: He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.

GEORGE: Man, would I like to see the look on his face.



MORTY: You believe this?

HELEN: What?

MORTY: It's Velcro.

HELEN: You're kidding.

JERRY: Main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean?
