

JERRY: The old fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go, "How do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly. 






MRTUTTLE: Well George, we here at Sanlac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients. 

GEORGE: Well a lot of people consider me uh, small and prestigious.

MRTUTTLE: That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I don't, I don't have to uh, explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately. 

GEORGE: I enjoy understanding. 

MRTUTTLE: I want you to have this job. Of course...



CLARISSE: Mr. Zimmer is on line two.

MRTUTTLE: Great, thanks.



MRTUTTLE: I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in. 








GEORGE: I want you to have this job. Of course... 

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: That's it. 

JERRY: What do you mean that's it? 

GEORGE: He never finished his sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview. 

JERRY: "Of course" was the last thing he said? 

GEORGE: Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates." 

ELAINE: "I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time." 

JERRY: "I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite." 



GEORGE: Alright. 

ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him? 

GEORGE: Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him. 

JERRY: So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job. 

GEORGE: And if I don't call... 

JERRY: You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it? 

GEORGE: Rest stop supply. 

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: Oh.

ELAINE: Good for you.



KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey. 

JERRY: Shower? 

KRAMER: Haircut. 

JERRY: Oh.

KRAMER: I'm very happy with this.

JERRY: Who'd you use? Gino? 

KRAMER: Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair. 

ELAINE: What butcher? 

KRAMER: The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses. 

JERRY: Well I've been going to him for twelve years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings. 

ELAINE: Yeah, you never get good haircuts. 

KRAMER: You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself. 

JERRY: Really? 

KRAMER: Mmm hmm.

ELAINE: Yeah. You know what? You should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction. 

KRAMER: What bachelor auction? 

ELAINE: Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity. 

KRAMER: And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio. 

JERRY: I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time. 

KRAMER: Polio? 

ELAINE: Will you go ahead? You need a haircut. 

JERRY: Okay. 

KRAMER: Yeah. What are you all dressed up for? 

GEORGE: I had a job interview. 

KRAMER: Yeah. How'd it go? 

GEORGE: Good. Of course...






ENZO: Ah Jerry!

JERRY: Oh, hi Enzo. 

ENZO: Oh, you've come for the haircut. 

JERRY: Uh, no, actually I was just gonna... 

ENZO: It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal. 

JERRY: Well uh, if it's your day off I really...



ENZO: Eh, what's the difference? It takes ten minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you. 

JERRY: Well I don't want to take too much off. 

ENZO: Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair. 

MANGETTINGHAIRCUT: Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had. 






GEORGE: He massacred you. 

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: You look like you're five years old. 

JERRY: What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps. 

GEORGE: You've got to start seeing sombody else. Get out of this relationship. 

JERRY: I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by. 

GEORGE: Well, you gotta do it. 

JERRY: I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart. 



KRAMER: No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo. 

JERRY: He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there. 

KRAMER: So what? 

JERRY: So I didn't want to hurt his feelings. 

KRAMER: His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. 

JERRY: Yeah but...



KRAMER: I'm not going to let you. Now if you don't call him I will. 

JERRY: No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that. 

KRAMER: Now I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him and we're going to get that haircut fixed up. 

JERRY: I don't want you to call him. 

KRAMER: Alright, gees. You're crazy. 



GEORGE: So uh, I still haven't heard about that job. 

JERRY: Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that? 

GEORGE: I have an idea. 

JERRY: Yeah? 

GEORGE: I show up. 

JERRY: What do you mean you show up? 

GEORGE: I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced. 

JERRY: Hmm. Not bad. 

GEORGE: What's the worst thing that could happen? 

JERRY: Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs. 

GEORGE: Yeah, so? 

JERRY: Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.




GEORGE: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. 

CLARISSE: How can I help you? 

GEORGE: Uh, the name's George Costanza. Ah, I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could uh, tell me where my office is. 

CLARISSE: I wasn't aware that uh, Mike, this is George Costanza. He's starting here today?

MIKE: Welcome aboard. 



GEORGE: Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard. 

MIKE: I didn't know that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing. 

GEORGE: Oh well, he was uh, probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.



CLARISSE: He wants to know where his office is. 

MIKE: Oh, uh, alright let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a uh, the small one over here. You know I should ask Jack. 



GEORGE: Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll uh, just take the small office. 

MIKE: Really? 

GEORGE: Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled. 

MIKE: Alright, alright it's eight oh eight right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that. 

GEORGE: Yes yes, of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that.



GEORGE: Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out. 














JERRY: So what did you do there all day? 

GEORGE: They gave me the Pensky file. 

JERRY: So it's a nice place to work? 

GEORGE: You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me. 



GEORGE: We're like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so we had a little party with cake you know, and champagne. I made a toast. 



JERRY: What about your boss? The guy who interviewed you? 

GEORGE: He'll be back on Monday. 



JERRY: Hi. 

GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Hi. How come you're wearing a hat? 

JERRY: I got a haircut. 

ELAINE: Oh yeah? Can I see it? 

JERRY: Oh there's nothing to see. 

ELAINE: Come on. Let me see it. 

JERRY: Forget it. 

ELAINE: Come on. 

JERRY: Alright. 



JERRY: Alright, that's very good. Thank you.

ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

JERRY: Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction. 

ELAINE: What? No Jerry, you have to go. 

GEORGE: You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day. 

ELAINE: Yeah, too bad. 




KRAMER: It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it. 

GINO: Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair. 

KRAMER: Yeah yeah yeah.



GINO: So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen. 

ENZO: Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor. 

GINO: Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man. 

ENZO: Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? What are you going to do on the toilet? 

KRAMER: I'd like to have shoehorn hands. 






KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut. 

ELAINE: Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction. 

JERRY: Yeah, but how am I... 

KRAMER: No buts. His apartment tonight, eight o'clock. 

ELAINE: Can he fix it? 

KRAMER: I don't know. 




GINO: Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair. 

JERRY: Oh thank you. 

GINO: I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time. 

JERRY: Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while. 

GINO: I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is. 

JERRY: That's nice of you to say. 



GINO: Just a second. Yes?

ENZO: It's your uncle Enzo. 

GINO: It's Uncle Enzo! Go in there. I'll clean up. 







GINO: Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here? 

ENZO: I've come to apologize. 

GINO: Apologize? 

ENZO: Yeah. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry. 

GINO: He make me cry too. You want something to drink? 

ENZO: Hey, what's all of this? 

GINO: Nothing. It's just hair. 

ENZO: You do haircut in the apartment? 

GINO: No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald. 

ENZO: It looks very familiar. 




JERRY: In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good. 

KRAMER: Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: I told you he could do it. 

JERRY: Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor. 

KRAMER: Yeah, so? 

JERRY: I think he knew. 

KRAMER: No. He doesn't know. 

JERRY: Who do you know? He knows my hair. 

KRAMER: Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together. 

JERRY: Okay, okay. 



ELAINE: What happened? It looks the same. 

JERRY: He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught. 

ELAINE: Jerry, the auction is in a few hours. 

JERRY: Take the K-man. 

ELAINE: You can still go. 

KRAMER: What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque. 

ELAINE: You think? 

KRAMER: Do I think? He's repugnant. 



ELAINE: What would you wear? 

KRAMER: Whatever it takes. 




ENZO: See, now Newman is a good customer. 

NEWMAN: Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it. 

ENZO: Oh, not everybody like Newman, so loyal. 

NEWMAN: Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special. 

ENZO: You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business. 

GINO: I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back. 

ENZO: Take your time.



ENZO: You happy with the haircut? 

NEWMAN: It's okay. A little crooked. 

ENZO: How'd you like to have free haircut for six months. 

NEWMAN: What's the catch? 

ENZO: You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair. 

NEWMAN: Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts and a comb.








CLARISSE: Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you. 

GEORGE: Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file? 



PENSKY: Costanza? Arthur Pensky. 

GEORGE: Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion style folder.

PENSKY: Where's Tuttle? 

GEORGE: He's on vacation. 

PENSKY: He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. 



PENSKY: Looks like you put a lot of work into this. 

GEORGE: Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog. 

PENSKY: Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me? 

GEORGE: Really? 

PENSKY: You are aware... 



CLARISSE: Mr. Costanza? 

GEORGE: Not now Florence. 

CLARISSE: I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car. 

PENSKY: Damn this city. 



GEORGE: I am aware! I am aware!




GINO: He knows. He knows about us. 

JERRY: How do you know? 

GINO: Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair. 



JERRY: Who is it? 

NEWMAN: It's Newman. 

GINO: He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here. 

JERRY: Alright, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape. 



JERRY: What do you want? 



NEWMAN: Can I use your bathroom? 

JERRY: What's wrong with yours? 

NEWMAN: My toilet's clogged. 

JERRY: You can't unclog it? 

NEWMAN: No. 

JERRY: Did you ask Kramer? 

NEWMAN: He's out. 

JERRY: Number one? 

NEWMAN: Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly. 

JERRY: Alright. Flush twice. 



NEWMAN: No.



NEWMAN: Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.



NEWMAN: Unbelievable, nothing.



NEWMAN: Ah. 



JERRY: Alright? 

NEWMAN: Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY: Alright, I'll see you later. 

NEWMAN: What are you doing? 

JERRY: I'm watching Edward Scissorhands. 

NEWMAN: Oh, can I watch a little? Because it's my favorite movie. 

JERRY: Yeah alright. 



JERRY: You want something to drink? 

NEWMAN: No. No.



JERRY: If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber. 



NEWMAN: Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel.










ENZO: Did you get it?



ENZO: Oh, you done good Newman. 

NEWMAN: It was a cinch. Where are you going? 

ENZO: Io volgio vendetta. 




ELAINE: Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate. 



ELAINE: A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much. 



ELAINE: Okay next bachelor is number um, one twenty-four on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate. 

KRAMER: Equivalency. 

ELAINE: Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate.



ELAINE: He's uh, self employed. He's, I don't know, six foot three, one hundred and ninety pounds. He likes uh, fruit and he just got uh, a haircut. 



ELAINE: Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear um, five bucks? 




JERRY: I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy?



JERRY: Just asking. 



JERRY: Who is it? 

ENZO: Enzo Manginero!



JERRY: Oh my God, he knows!



JERRY: Go. One second. 



ENZO: It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night!

JERRY: No, I wasn't there.



ENZO: Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up. 

JERRY: Sample? Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book. 



GINO: Don't Jerry. 

ENZO: So, it's true. 

GINO: Yes, it's true. 

ENZO: I'm going to kill the both of you!








GEORGE: Mr. Tuttle, you're back. 

MRTUTTLE: George, I'm surprised to see you here. 

GEORGE: You are? 

MRTUTTLE: I thought you would have taken the large office. 

GEORGE: Oh really?

MRTUTTLE: I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week.

GEORGE: Ah, here it is.



MRTUTTLE: What have you been doing all week? 

GEORGE: Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace. 

MRTUTTLE: You haven't done anything with this. 

GEORGE: Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office. 

MRTUTTLE: I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything. 

GEORGE: You are aware that Pensky is interested in me. 

MRTUTTLE: You're not Pensky material. 

GEORGE: Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta ta, Tuttle. 
















PENSKY: Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What I was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you. 

GEORGE: Obviously. 



PENSKY: Yes. 










KRAMER: So when are you gonna be able to go out?



NEWMAN: Not for a while.
