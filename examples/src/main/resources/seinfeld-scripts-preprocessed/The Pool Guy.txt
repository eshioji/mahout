

JERRY: I�d like to know when tic tac toe became the pound sign, that's what I�d like to know. Why don't they call it what it really is, �Leave your numeric message now and then press Archie�s head.� And what is that redial button? Let's face it, you're either going to get the person, the machine, or they have call waiting. Who is redialing and redialing? This is like the harassment key for people in a fight, you know.



JERRY: �Hey I�m not through.� Click. �You can't do that to me.� Click. �And another thing.� Click.




GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?

JERRY: Well, what do you mean?

GEORGE: Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying, who do you think would win?

JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious.

GEORGE: Yeah, me too.



JERRY: Hey Elaine.

ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Who who who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here.



ELAINE: You mean in a real fight fight?

JERRY: Mono a baldo.

ELAINE: George.

GEORGE: Ah ha!



JERRY: Why?

ELAINE: George fights dirty.

JERRY: Really? What would you do?

GEORGE: Pull hair, poke eyes, groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do.

JERRY: Hmm.

ELAINE: So listen, you're not doing anything tomorrow are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.

JERRY: I�m sorry.

ELAINE: George?

GEORGE: Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

ELAINE: There's nobody I can go with.



ELAINE: You know what. I don't have one female friend left.

KRAMER: Oh no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women and they hate you.

ELAINE: Thank you.

KRAMER: So Jerry, what time we going to the movies?

JERRY: Ah, how about eight thirty?

KRAMER: Saddle up and ride.



JERRY: You want to get something to eat first?



KRAMER: No, I�m good.

GEORGE: I wonder if ah, Susan...



GEORGE: No, I better just go. Heh. Alright! See you.



KRAMER: There's nothing more pathetic than a grown man who�s afraid of a woman.

JERRY: Hey, why don't you ask Susan?

ELAINE: George's Susan?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Yeah. Why not Susan? I should be friends with Susan.



ELAINE: Of course! Susan! Oh! Okay, I�ll see you guys. Huh.





KRAMER: That's gonna be trouble.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Jerry, don't you see? This world here.



KRAMER: This is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?






KRAMER: Did I tell you I�m getting a new telephone number?

JERRY: How come?

KRAMER: Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.





RAMON: Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?

JERRY: Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.

KRAMER: Oh yeah.

RAMON: So you know what happened don't you?

JERRY: No what?

RAMON: I got fired.

JERRY: Really?

RAMON: Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool.

JERRY: Ah.

RAMON: Hey well, uh, stay out of the deep end, eh?

JERRY: Okay, see you later.

KRAMER: What's in the deep end?






GEORGE: Hello?

ELAINE: Hey George.

GEORGE: Hey Lainey. What's going on?

ELAINE: Nothing much, um, can I talk to Susan

GEORGE: Ha, yeah right. Hang on, I�ll ah, I�ll get her for you. Seriously, what's up?

ELAINE: No. George really, can I talk to Susan?

GEORGE: Susan, why?

ELAINE: Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.

GEORGE: Oh I don't think you want to do that.

ELAINE: Why not?

GEORGE: Well what would be the point of that?



ELAINE: George, are you going to put her on the phone?

GEORGE: Where did this come from all of a sudden?

ELAINE: George are you going to let me talk to Susan or not?

GEORGE: I really think I should have been consulted about this.



GEORGE: Here, something.

SUSAN: Hello? Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.






KRAMER: You want to sit here?

JERRY: Yeah.



JERRY: Uh uh uh uh, over there.



KRAMER: Why?

JERRY: Little buffer zone.

KRAMER: Buffer zone.



JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?

KRAMER: You got a point.

JERRY: Alright.



KRAMER: I can't...

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Well these seats have no lumbar.



JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pretend we're talking.



KRAMER: We are talking.

JERRY: Pretend it's interesting.

KRAMER: So uh, then I had to kill him and uh, well the police are still looking for me.

JERRY: That's shocking, but sounds...

RAMON: Hey, hi Jerry.

JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon.

RAMON: Hey hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?

JERRY: Oh, no thanks.



RAMON: Hey uh, is this seat taken?



JERRY: No.






JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie he leached on to us. We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.

GEORGE: By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?

JERRY: No why?

GEORGE: She called Susan last night.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.

GEORGE: How do you know?

JERRY: Well it was my idea.

GEORGE: Your idea?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What did you do that for?

JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with.

GEORGE: Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now!?

JERRY: World's collide.

GEORGE: Well yeah!

JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact...

GEORGE: Yes! It blows up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?

JERRY: I didn�t know. Kramer told me about the worlds.

GEORGE: You couldn't figure out the �World's Theory� for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, you gotta keep your worlds apart.

JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.



KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: He knows the world�s theory.

KRAMER: What is it blowing up?

GEORGE: Ha!





KRAMER: Cosmo, go. No, no, nah, nah.



KRAMER: Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy. Wrong numbers every five minutes.

JERRY: What is it?

KRAMER: Well it's five five five three four five five.

JERRY: five five five three four five five.

KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Five five five three four five five. Well wait a second, don't you see? That's five five five filk.

KRAMER: What's filk?

JERRY: Filk�s nothing, but five five five film is Movie Phone.

KRAMER: Oh, Movie Phone.

JERRY: Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.

KRAMER: So I�m filk?

JERRY: You're filk.

KRAMER: Oh mama.




ELAINE: Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the nineteenth Amendment party. Huh. Eye yi yi.

SUSAN: Oh, quite the Decolletage for a suffragette, yeah?

ELAINE: Well it must have been one hell of a party.

SUSAN: Woo.



SUSAN: Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.

ELAINE: What?

SUSAN: Eh, forget it.

ELAINE: What? You can tell me. I�ll put it in the vault.

SUSAN: The vault?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.




LOCKERROOMATTENDANTONE: Oy, Mr. Seinfeld. We heard you went to the movies with Ramon.

JERRY: Oh well, I didn�t actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there.



LOCKERROOMATTENDANTTWO: It's a good thing he has friends like you to cheer him up.

LOCKERROOMATTENDANTONE: Tell him to call us.

LOCKERROOMATTENDANTTWO: Tell him, Dustin says, �Hello.�

JERRY: Alright, I gotta go.

LOCKERROOMATTENDANTONE: To see Ramon?






JERRY: What else did you two do?

ELAINE: Oh I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.

JERRY: Ah, so uh, flower shows and shopping for pretty bows and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?



ELAINE: That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?

JERRY: Yes, I do.

ELAINE: Alrighty.



JERRY: Hey, you know George isn't too happy uh, about your new friendship.

ELAINE: Yeah? Well I don't really give a...





KRAMER: Hey man, what's going on?

JERRY: Hey.



KRAMER: Oh, here we go.



KRAMER: Yeah hello. Yeah, no no no, hold on.



KRAMER: Yeah, Cupid�s Rifle, eight thirty, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no no no, no problem, yeah.



JERRY: You're looking up movies for people now?

KRAMER: I got time.



KRAMER: And this.



KRAMER: Cosmo. Yeah, uh huh, no no no no, I�ll help. Yeah, Firestorm�s good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry uh, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here. He holds the phone out to Jerry]

JERRY: No Kramer, I don't want to talk to him.



KRAMER: Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it.



KRAMER: Yes, are you still there? Look I�m sorry about that. Alright there's an eight thirty and a ten fifteen showing.





JERRY: Oh that's George. Yeah?

RAMON: Hey it's Ramon.

JERRY: What?

RAMON: Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. I�m coming up.

JERRY: Oh, oh okay. What, what is he doing here?

ELAINE: Who, who is Ramon?

JERRY: He's the pool guy.

ELAINE: What pool guy?

JERRY: Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.

ELAINE: Yeah, no problem.



RAMON: Hey hey hey Jerry.



RAMON: How are you, crazy guy?

JERRY: Hey. So uh, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.

ELAINE: Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye bye Jerry.



JERRY: So uh, what are you doing around here Ramon?

RAMON: Well I was in the neighborhood. I figured I�d check you out.

JERRY: Ah, actually I kind of had some things to do.

RAMON: Oh, oh yeah. What? Where you going?

JERRY: Ah, just you know, I don't know. Stuff I gotta do.



RAMON: Hey that's cool. I�m up for some stuff

JERRY: Alright.






RAMON: So get this. I get down there and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it?

JERRY: Alright Ramon, I got to get going.



JERRY: I think we should separate here actually.

RAMON: What are you trying to say Jerry?



JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.

RAMON: Oh I see. It's because I clean pools, right?

JERRY: That has nothing to do with it.

RAMON: You.






SUSAN: Yeah, we got along real well.

GEORGE: You know uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't you? Something strange about a woman whose friends are all men?

SUSAN: Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.

GEORGE: You talked all about that?

SUSAN: Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.

GEORGE: Did you just say vault?

SUSAN: Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?

GEORGE: You got that from Elaine.

SUSAN: Yeah. So what?

GEORGE: Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?

SUSAN: I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.

GEORGE: We�d all go to movie on Friday?

SUSAN: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!




GEORGE: Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him ceases to exist! You see, right now, I have relationship George, but there is also independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with. Movie George, coffee shop George, liar George, bawdy George.

JERRY: I, I love that George.

GEORGE: Me too! And he's dying Jerry! If relationship George walks through this door.



GEORGE: He will kill independent George! A George divided against itself cannot stand!





GEORGE: You're killing independent George! You know that, don't you?

ELAINE: George I don't even want to get...

GEORGE: You know what word Susan used last night? Huh. Vault!

ELAINE: So?

GEORGE: She got that from you.

ELAINE: Well, I didn�t tell here to say it.

GEORGE: Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl!?

ELAINE: I like her!

GEORGE: You see? You see? You see what I�m talking about? It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. 



JERRY: So you want to catch a movie later?

ELAINE: Ah yeah, sure.

JERRY: I don't have a paper though.

ELAINE: Hmm.





KRAMER: Hello and welcome to movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot ninety-seven. Coming to theaters this Friday, Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon, You've got to get me over that mountain! Now!



KRAMER: There is no place higher than... Mountain High. Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.

ELAINE: Kramer, is that you?

KRAMER: Elaine?

ELAINE: Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?

KRAMER: I don't know.





RAMON: Well well, look who�s here.

JERRY: Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.

RAMON: No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back.

JERRY: What?

RAMON: I�m a pool boy... again.

JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. I�m sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.

RAMON: Do you?

JERRY: What happened to all the towels?

RAMON: Oh ah, I guess they must have disappeared.





NEWMAN: Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot!









JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.

ELAINE: Uh, so frustrating!

JERRY: Tell me about it.

ELAINE: Uh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?

JERRY: You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I�m meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.

ELAINE: Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.






SUSAN: Hey Elaine! Jerry. Over here!

KRAMER: There they are.

SUSAN: Yeah, look who I ran into.

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Yeah.



KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Ah.



KRAMER: Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?

JERRY: Ah you know, I�m supposed to meet uh, someone. I�ll, I�ll wait for them outside.



KRAMER: Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?

JERRY: This is going to be ugly.



SUSAN: What's that Jerry?

JERRY: I said, boy am I ugly.



SUSAN: Oh hey hey, Georgie boy, over here.





GEORGE: One, two...



GEORGE: ...three, four.



GEORGE: Ha Ho!



SUSAN: Hey George!

JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.







JERRY: I see you there Ramon.



JERRY: Hey, I'll just keep swimming. Hey hey, I�m not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I�m a member here, this is my place to swim.



JERRY: Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.



RAMON: Oh.



NEWMAN: Olly olly oxen free!



JERRY: No!




JERRY: I think he's gonna need mouth to mouth resuscitation.

NEWMAN: Mouth to mouth?

JERRY: Yeah.

NEWMAN: Huh.

JERRY: Well? Go ahead.

NEWMAN: You go.

JERRY: You knocked him out.

NEWMAN: Yeah, but you pulled him in.

JERRY: Come on Newman. Do it.

NEWMAN: Nah.

JERRY: He might die.

NEWMAN: Yeah. Maybe.




ELAINE: Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater.



ELAINE: Okay, next showings at nine, we can't wait any longer.

SUSAN: Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear.

ELAINE: Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?

SUSAN: Oh, I don't know.

ELAINE: Oh come on, come on, come on.



ELAINE: �George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel with Jerry." Love?

SUSAN: Yeah.

ELAINE: �Love Susan.�




JERRY: So eventually these people came and somebody gave him mouth to mouth.

ELAINE: He could have died

JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble.

SUSAN: Why didn�t you give him mouth to mouth?

JERRY: Ah.



ELAINE: How can you possibly show your face there again?

JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too, you know. We can't go anywhere near there.



ELAINE: Hi. Ah, three for Chunnel, two adults... one child.




GEORGE: What the hell is this? �George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel with Jerry.� With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great!



GEORGE: Probably went to the eighty-fourth street. That's where I always go with Jerry.

JERRY: What did you think Susan?

SUSAN: Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.

ELAINE: Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?

JERRY: Yeah.

SUSAN: Ah no, I don't think so.

ELAINE: Why not?

SUSAN: Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. I�ll see you.



GEORGE: I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.

MOVIEUSHER: Let's go pal.

GEORGE: They're, they're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
