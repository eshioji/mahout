

ELAINE: So, Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.



TIMWHATLEY: Hey! Happy Chanukah!

JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.



TIMWHATLEY: Eh?



ELAINE: eh.

TIMWHATLEY: Oh.



TIMWHATLEY: Hey George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew.



TIMWHATLEY: Oh hey, listen, I'd better circulate.



TIMWHATLEY: Happy Chanukah, Tiffany!

ELAINE: This place is like Studio Fifty-four with a menorah.

GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.



ELAINE: Oh.



ELAINE: I got denim vest checking me out. Fake phone number's coming out tonight.

JERRY: You have a standard fake?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.



JERRY: That's neat.



ELAINE: No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!



DENIMVEST: Hi!



JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.

GWEN: Hi.

JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.



ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the big metal buttons

DENIMVEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should uh, go out some time?

ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?






GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?

GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.

JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing, "We don't care, and it shows."

JERRY: You're gonna open your mail here?

GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.



GEORGE: "Have you seen me?"



GEORGE: Nope.



GEORGE: Whoa, something from Whatley.

JERRY: See? You give and you get.

GEORGE: "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance?"

JERRY: Oh, that's nice.

GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"

JERRY: To a children's charity!

GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!



ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hey.



ELAINE: Oh, nothing for me.



ELAINE: I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.

JERRY: "Atomic Sub?" Why are you eating there?

ELAINE: I got a card and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. Twenty-four stamps and I become a submarine...



ELAINE: ...captain.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: Free sub.



ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

ELAINE: What is it?



ELAINE: "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?

GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it.

JERRY: When George was growing up...

GEORGE: Jerry, No!

JERRY: His father...

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.

ELAINE: Oh. And another piece of the puzzle falls into place.

GEORGE: Alright.

JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?



GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!

JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?



GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! Are you happy now?!








ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card! Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: I've eaten twenty-three bad subs. I just need one more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!

JERRY: No, you walk out.

ELAINE: Alright then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.

JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!

ELAINE: I want that free sub.

JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! They're cloning sheep now.

KRAMER: No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!

JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow off number and see if he's called it?

ELAINE: That's a good idea.



KRAMER: Yeah, Go! What? Really? Yeah, okay. Yeah! Bye.



KRAMER: Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.

JERRY: What strike?

KRAMER: Yeah, H and H Bagels. That's where I worked.

JERRY: You?

ELAINE: Worked?

JERRY: Bagels?

KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.



KRAMER: Yeah, we've been on strike for twelve years.

ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there but I haven't seen them in a long time.

KRAMER: Yeah, well H and H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.

ELAINE: What were your demands?

KRAMER: Yeah, five thirty-five an hour. And that's what they're paying now.

ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.

KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that! Alright, I've got to go.



JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?

KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!








KRAMER: Alright, everybody! I'm back!

BAGELMANAGER: Who are you?

KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer. Strikes over.

BAGELMANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.

KRAMER: Huh. What, didn't any of the guys come back?

BAGELMANAGER: No, Iï¿½m sure they all got jobs like, ten years ago.

KRAMER: Oh man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.

BAGELMANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays.

KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!



KRAMER: What are those?

BAGELMANAGER: Those are raisin bagels.



KRAMER: I never thought I'd live to see that.






ELAINE: So anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.

BOOKIE: So, you're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls for you for five years.

ELAINE: So listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number...

BOOKIE: Hey Charlie! Guess who's here? Elaine Benes.



CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!



BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.

CHARLIE: I'm a man.

ELAINE: Oh. My.

BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just uh, give it to me and that way I'll have it.



ELAINE: My number? Oh...



ELAINE: Okay. Uh, well, there you go.



ELAINE: And uh, tell you what.



ELAINE: Put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.






TIMWHATLEY: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey, Tim.

TIMWHATLEY: What's up?

JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.

TIMWHATLEY: Mazel Tov.



GWEN: Jerry, hi.

JERRY: Gwen?

GWEN: Yeah.

JERRY: Really?

GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.






GEORGE: So, attractive one day, not attractive the next?

JERRY: Have you come across this?

GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome. She's a two-face.

JERRY: Like the Batman villain?

GEORGE: If that helps you.

JERRY: So, if I ask her out again I don't know who's showing up. The good, the bad, or the ugly.

GEORGE: Clint Eastwood!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley.



JERRY: "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." What is that?

GEORGE: Made it up.

JERRY: "The Human Fund. Money for people."

GEORGE: What do you think?

JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.

GEORGE: The Outlaw of Josey Whales!

JERRY: Yeah.





KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen. Bagels on the house!

JERRY: How was your first day?

KRAMER: Oh, fantastic!



KRAMER: It felt so good to get my hands back in that dough.



JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?

KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels.



KRAMER: Yeah, they're day olds. The homeless won't even touch them.



KRAMER: Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig, they, they test.



GEORGE: Alright. Uh well, I'm out of here.



JERRY: Happy Festivus!

KRAMER: What's Festivus?

JERRY: When George was growing up...

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: His father...

GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!



ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.

GEORGE: God!



KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!

ELAINE: Kramer listen, I got a little phone relay going so if a guy calls H and H and he's looking for me, you take a message.

JERRY: You're still trying to get that free sub?

ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now.

JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?

ELAINE: Maybe.




FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?

KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?

FRANK: Many Christmases ago I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had but so did another man. As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!

KRAMER: What happened to the doll?

FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"

KRAMER: That must of been some kind of doll.

FRANK: She was.






GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.



SANDYHERRING: Oh... thanks.



GEORGE: Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming!







GEORGE: Ah, Mr. Kruger, sir. Merry Christmas!



KRUGER: Not if you could see our books. What's this?

GEORGE: The Human Fund.

KRUGER: Whatever.



GEORGE: Exactly. Erica!






FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner you gather your family around and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.

KRAMER: Is there a tree?

FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.

KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.

FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.



ELAINE: Hello, Frank.

FRANK: Hello, woman.

ELAINE: Kramer! Kramer, any word from the vest?

KRAMER: No. Ah listen, Harry, I need the twenty-third off.

BAGELMANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.

KRAMER: But it's Festivus.

BAGELMANAGER: What?

KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.

BAGELMANAGER: That's not a right.

KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine.



KRAMER: It's a walk out!

ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.

KRAMER: What? You're siding with management?!

ELAINE: No, I just...

KRAMER: Scab! Scab!



KRAMER: Scab!






GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: Boy am I glad to see you.

GWEN: You were expecting someone else?

JERRY: You never know.

GWEN: You know, you might want to take the tunnel.

JERRY: So uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?



GWEN: I can go either way.

JERRY: You're telling me.




GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth?

JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.

GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.

JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?

GEORGE: Lights out.

JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links by the way.

GEORGE: Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!

JERRY: That's not a French cuff shirt, you know.

GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.

JERRY: Oh, that's classy.



KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus.

GEORGE: What is that? Is that the pole?!

FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage, its part of who you are.

GEORGE: That's why I hate it.

KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house, everyone's invited.

FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the cassette tapes.



FRANK: Read that poem.

GEORGE: I can't read it. I need my glasses!

FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!

ESTELLE: Leave him alone!

FRANK: Alright George, it's time for the feats of strength.



GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!



GEORGE: I hate Festivus!

FRANK: We had some good times.



GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: Hi there. This is Kramer and Frank.

GWEN: Hi.



KRAMER: Hello.

GWEN: So, you ready to go?

JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.



JERRY: Now this is a good looking booth.






KRAMER: Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels.





BAGELMANAGER: Lady, if you want a sandwich I'll make you a sandwich.

ELAINE: I want the one that I earned.



ELAINE: I'll get it. I'll get it! H and H and Elaine.



KRAMER: Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.

ELAINE: What did you do?

KRAMER: You've been warned.



ELAINE: Oh, hi!





BAGELWORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke.

BAGELMANAGER: Can we still make bagels?

BAGELWORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.



KRAMER: Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!







KRUGER: George, I got something for you.



KRUGER: I'm supposed to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me so what's the difference?



GEORGE: Twenty thousand dollars?

KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund.



KRUGER: Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.




GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this place?

JERRY: Why? It's our place.

GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup.

JERRY: Oh, I know who's cooking today!



GEORGE: Hey! Surprise, surprise!

JERRY: Hey, Georgie!

GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go.

JERRY: I'll be here.



GEORGE: Hey, soup.

JERRY: She didn't touch it.



GEORGE: Oh Paco!



GEORGE: Hey, take a look at this.



JERRY: Twenty thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Excuse me?

GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.

JERRY: You want to give something back? Start with the twenty thousand dollars.

GEORGE: I'm serious.

JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?

GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist, a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money and people would love me. Then they would come to me and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! First thing I'm gonna need is a driver.






ELAINE: Kramer, the vest just called.



KRAMER: Yama hama! It's fright night!

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in ten minutes I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.

KRAMER: And?

ELAINE: Free sub. I'll see you.

KRAMER: Yeah.



GWEN: Kramer, Hi!

KRAMER: Oh, hello.

GWEN: It's Gwen. We met at the coffee shop.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry.

KRAMER: Ah, I don't know who you really are but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend and she's not you. You're much better looking and like, a foot taller.

GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.

KRAMER: Oh, he's a tomcat.






ELAINE: Steve.

DENIMVEST: Hmm?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

DENIMVEST: From Tim Whatley's party?

ELAINE: Yeah.

DENIMVEST: You look... different.

ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. Do you have that card that I gave you?

DENIMVEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now. I'll give it to you later or something.

ELAINE: No no no, you give me your number.

DENIMVEST: Okay. Sure.



DENIMVEST: Do you have the mumps?

ELAINE: No.

DENIMVEST: Typhoid?

ELAINE: No.



DENIMVEST: Yama hama!



ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!




KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo here from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.

GEORGE: Well, there could be.

KRUGER: But there isn't.

GEORGE: Well I, I could uh, I could give the money back. Here.



KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.

GEORGE: Well sir, I, I gave out the fake card because um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I um, I celebrate Festivus.

KRUGER: Venomous?

GEORGE: Festivus, sir. And uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, sir!

KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?

GEORGE: Oh no, sir. Festivus is all too real. And I could prove it if I had to.

KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.




GEORGE: Happy Festivus!

FRANK: George? This is a surprise.



FRANK: Who's the suit?

GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.

FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?

GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.

FRANK: He's gonna see it.



GEORGE: Happy Festivus!



GEORGE: Yama hama!

ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?

GEORGE: Embracing my roots.

JERRY: They nailed you on the twenty G's?

GEORGE: Busted cold.



FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength to weight ratio.

KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.





KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!



KRAMER: He he he!

BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.

ELAINE: What are you doing here?

BOOKIE: Damnedest thing, me and Charlie were calling to ask you out and uh, we got this bagel place.

KRAMER: I told them I was just about to see you. It's a Festivus miracle!



ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!

FRANK: Let's begin.



KRUGER: Dr. Van Nostrand?

KRAMER: Uh, that's right.

FRANK: Welcome new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!

GEORGE: Oh God.

FRANK: Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe... I lost my train of thought.



GWEN: Jerry!

JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here?

GWEN: Kramer told me.

KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!



GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.

ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for six hours. Give me a break.



JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!



JERRY: Bad lighting on the porch.

ELAINE: Hey, how'd my horse do?

BOOKIE: He had to be shot.

FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.

GEORGE: Not the feats of strength.

FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Uh, oh. Oh gee Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H and H.

JERRY: I thought you were on strike?

KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little...



KRAMER: ...out there.

GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?



KRUGER: How about George?

FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me George, Festivus is not over!

GEORGE: Oh please, somebody stop this!



FRANK: Let's rumble!



ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!

GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.

FRANK: Stop crying and fight your father!

GEORGE: Ow! Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!

FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!






BAGELMANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired.

KRAMER: Thank you!
