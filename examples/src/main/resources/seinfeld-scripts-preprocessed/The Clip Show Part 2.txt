

JERRY: Wow. Nine years. A hundred and eighty shows.



JERRY: Same twelve boxes of cereal and millions and millions of dollars.



KRAMER: Jerry you in there?

JERRY: Busy We've made a lot of friends, shared a lot of laughs, often at the expense of others, and slept with... well who's counting?



KRAMER: Ah man, why's the door locked?

JERRY: I'm coming. Anyway watch this.

KRAMER: Oh, hello.

JERRY: Kramer!






JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking? 

ELAINE: Twenty-five percent. 

JERRY: Twenty-five percent you say? No way! It's like four to six percent. It's a twenty to one shot. 

ELAINE: You're way off. 

JERRY: Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there. 

ELAINE: So what you are saying is that ninety to ninety-five percent of the population is undateable? 

JERRY: Undateable! 

ELAINE: Then how are all these people getting together? 

JERRY: Alcohol.







JERRY: What about you? Do people make fun of your name?

DELORES: What do you expect when you name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy.



DELORES: Oh Jerry. 

JERRY: Oh... you.




NEWMAN: But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures and moments.






ELAINE: Alright, let's go, I'll give you half an hour. 

JERRY: What? 

ELAINE: Come on! 

JERRY: Are you serious? 

ELAINE: Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship. 

JERRY: Sex... to save the friendship.



JERRY: Well, if we have to we have to.










GEORGE: What's going on?

SCAMWOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.

GEORGE: Get going? But we haven't really, you know...



SCAMWOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?

GEORGE: What are you doing? You're robbing me?

SCAMWOMAN: I wasted my whole morning on you for eight dollars?

GEORGE: Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?

SCAMWOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.

GEORGE: No no, that's my only suit. It cost me three hundred and fifty dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.

SCAMWOMAN: Bye George.

GEORGE: Well you can't just leave me here!



GEORGE: Will I see you again?




ELAINE: So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Okay.

KRAMER: Have we been intimate?

ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

KRAMER: And how often do we do it?

ELAINE: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?

KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. We do it, uh... five times a week, okay?

KRAMER: Oh, baby.



ELAINE: Oh my God.




JERRY: So we're uh, fooling around there you know, it's getting a little passionate... 


JERRY: ...and uh, she starts with the dirty talking. 

GEORGE: Alright, alright, hold on! Time out! Whoa, whoa!



GEORGE: What did she say? 

JERRY: Oh you know, the usual. 

GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual? 

JERRY: Typical things. 



GEORGE: What typical? Give me typical. Give me some typical. 

JERRY: She says, uh...








NANCY: Ow, George!



NANCY: What are you doing? 



GEORGE: Uh... you know, uh... pleasuring you?

NANCY: It feels like aliens poking at my body.






ELAINE: So, you think you're spongeworthy? 

BILLY: Yes, I think I'm spongeworthy. I think I'm very spongeworthy. 

ELAINE: Run down your case for me again? 

BILLY: Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport, I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm, I eat well, I exercise, Blood tests immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it. 

ELAINE: You going to do something about your sideburns? 

BILLY: Yeah, I told you, I'm going to trim my sideburns.



ELAINE: Alright, let's go.






GEORGE: I might tell her that I love her.

JERRY: Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the "I love you" return? 

GEORGE: Fifty fifty. 

JERRY: Because if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoth ball hanging out there.

GEORGE: Aw, I've just got to say it once. Everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it? 

ELAINE: What, you never said it? 

GEORGE: Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.




MARISATOMEI: So tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken? 

GEORGE: Well Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.













GEORGE: What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else? 

JERRY: Depends. 

GEORGE: Depends on what? 

JERRY: On many factors. 

GEORGE: Like what? 

JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily? 

GEORGE: No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week. 

JERRY: What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out or is a date implied? 

GEORGE: Implied. 

JERRY: She got anything in your medicine cabinet? 

GEORGE: There might be some moisturizer. 

JERRY: Ah ha. Let me ask you this. Is there any Tampax in your house? 

GEORGE: Yeah. 

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here. 

GEORGE: What? 

JERRY: You got yourself a girlfriend. 

GEORGE: Ah, no no.







KRAMER: I mean, what are you thinking about Jerry? Marriage? Family? 

JERRY: Well... 

KRAMER: They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning, she's there. You go to sleep at night, she's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to, to use the bathroom.



KRAMER: Is it alright if I use the bathroom now? 

JERRY: Really? 

KRAMER: Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating. 

JERRY: I can? 

KRAMER: Oh yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner? 

JERRY: What? 

KRAMER: You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day? 

JERRY: Boy. 

KRAMER: It's sad, Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs. 

JERRY: I'm glad we had this talk. 

KRAMER: Oh, you have no idea!




SANDI: You're acting weird. Is anything wrong? 

JERRY: No. 

SANDI: Are you breaking up with me? 

JERRY: Are we going out? 

SANDI: You're breaking up with me, aren't you?

JERRY: Do you want me to break up with you? 

SANDI: If that's what you want. 

JERRY: I don't even know what you're talking about. 

SANDI: Fine. Break up with me. 

JERRY: Alright. We're broken up. 

SANDI: Can we still be friends?








GEORGE: Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex. 



ELAINE: I've yada yada'd sex. 

GEORGE: Really? 

ELAINE: Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again. 

JERRY: But you yada yada'd over the best part. 

ELAINE: No, I mentioned the bisk.




JERRY: You didn't have make up sex? How could you not have make up sex? That's the best feature of the heavy relationship. 

GEORGE: I missed out on the make up sex. 

JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make up sex is if you're sent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.




ELAINE: David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?

PUDDY: Gonna be rough.

ELAINE: Uh, you should be trying to save me!



PUDDY: Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.

ELAINE: I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.



PUDDY: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

ELAINE: Yeah, that's right!






GEORGE: If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him ceases to exist! You see, right now, I have relationship George, but there is also independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with. Movie George, coffee shop George, liar George, bawdy George. 

JERRY: I, I love that George. 

GEORGE: Me too! And he's dying Jerry! If relationship George walks through this door... 


GEORGE: ...he will kill independent George! A George divided against itself cannot stand! 








GILLIAN: Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY: No. No thanks, I'm just not hungry.

GILLIAN: Well, then at least drink your beer.



JERRY: Oh. Twist off.

GILLIAN: You have a little something on your face.





JERRY: She had man hands.




ELAINE: He's a regifter!




GEORGE: She's a two-face.




KRAMER: She's got the jimmy legs.




JERRY: She's a virgin.




ELAINE: He's poor.




KRAMER: She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.




JERRY: She eats her peas one at a time.




GEORGE: She just took credit for my salad.




JERRY: He's a male bimbo. He's a mimbo.




JERRY: She's one of these low talkers.




ELAINE: You know because he's a high talker.




JERRY: A bit of a close talker.




KRAMER: She can't hear very well out of her left ear.




JERRY: She's bald?

GEORGE: She's bald!




ELAINE: He's a bad breaker upper.




JERRY: She went out with Newman!




ELAINE: He's like a Svenjolly.




GEORGE: She's too tan.




JERRY: She's too good.




NEWMAN: She wasn't my type




GEORGE: She just dislikes me so much, it's irresistable.




KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain. 

JERRY: Yes. Yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this, I am going over to her apartment and I'm telling her to put those shades down! 

KRAMER: Whoa whoa whoa. What, what did you just say? 

JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, when I'm here I'm climbing the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest, something's gotta give!







ELAINE: He took it out. 

JERRY: He what? 

ELAINE: He took...



ELAINE: ...it out.




KRAMER: What are you doing to yourself?



JERRY: I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.

KRAMER: You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Every time you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.

JERRY: Oh that's an old wives tale.

KRAMER: Is it? Look at this.



JERRY: What, what is that!

KRAMER: Look at it! Look at it!




GEORGE: Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who 1pees in the shower, is that it?! 

ELAINE: No, that's not it! 

GEORGE: Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is! 

ELAINE: Why couldn't you just wait? 

GEORGE: I was there! I saw a drain! 

ELAINE: Since when is a drain a toilet?! 

GEORGE: It's all pipes! What's the difference?! 

ELAINE: Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix them up! 

GEORGE: I'll call a plumber right now!



JERRY: Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here? 

ELAINE: Okay!










KRAMER: Yeah! 





MRSROSS: What is that? 

MRROSS: I think it's the horse. 

MRSROSS: Oh God. 

KRAMER: Hey, how's everything? You, you need anything?

MRSROSS: I can't take this.



MRROSS: We can't breathe back here!

KRAMER: Rusty!



KRAMER: Rusty!




JERRY: So were going to make the post office pay for my new stereo now? 

KRAMER: It's a write off for them. 

JERRY: How is it a write off? 

KRAMER: They just write it off. 

JERRY: Write it off what? 

KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything 

JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. 

KRAMER: Do you? 

JERRY: No. I don't. 

KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off.




GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports. 

JERRY: Uh huh. Uh huh. In what capacity? 

GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. 

JERRY: Yeah. Well, that, that could be tough to get. 

GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game 

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. 

GEORGE: What about that? 

JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. 

GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair. 

JERRY: I know.




JERRY: And I tell you another thing, Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing and I don't care what the consequences are. 






























ELAINE: See you.
