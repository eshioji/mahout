

JERRY: You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union in the fancy buildings and they went out on strike. Now you would think, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them it would be doormen. "Let's see how they do without us!" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light with the dirty rag? "We demand shorter yellows and longer reds!"






DOORMANGUY: Whoa whoa whoa. May I help you?

JERRY: Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.

DOORMANGUY: Benes? No one here by that name.

JERRY: Oh, she's uh, she's house sitting for Mr. Pitt.

DOORMANGUY: Oh. House sitting, hmm.

JERRY: Yeah.

DOORMANGUY: What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?

JERRY: Can I just go up?

DOORMANGUY: Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job opening the door for you.



JERRY: How about those Knicks?

DOORMANGUY: Oh, I see. On the sports page.

JERRY: Yeah.

DOORMANGUY: What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.








KRAMER: So, you think your parents will get back together?

GEORGE: I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.



KRAMER: Hey George, stick them up.

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.

GEORGE: Why?

KRAMER: So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.



KRAMER: Alright, hands up, porky!



KRAMER: That's it. Now, give me your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!



KRAMER: Is that all you got?! Huh? Is that all you got?!

GEORGE: Alright, that's enough.

KRAMER: I'll tell you when it's enough!



KRAMER: Alright, now you better not say anything or I'll stalk you!








ELAINE: Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.



JERRY: I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.

ELAINE: What guy?

JERRY: The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mind games. What time does he get off?

ELAINE: Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier.



JERRY: Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait till he goes home?

ELAINE: I...

JERRY: We'll still make the movie.

ELAINE: Okay okay.








GEORGE: What'd you do today, dad?

FRANK: Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.

GEORGE: I don't have a hi-fi.

FRANK: Didn't I give you my old record player?

GEORGE: I gave it to Cosmo.

FRANK: Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?

KRAMER: I'm Cosmo.

FRANK: Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha cha record.

KRAMER: One two, cha cha cha.

GEORGE: Alright alright. Can we go out and eat?

FRANK: Let me change my shirt.








ELAINE: Jerry, it's six. Let's go.

JERRY: Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.



ELAINE: No, don't...

JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.



ELAINE: Give that to me.



ELAINE: Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?



MRPITT: Elaine, are you having a party?

ELAINE: A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.



JERRY: Alright, he just left. We can go.

MRPITT: Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.

ELAINE: Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.



MRPITT: I need to know what's in the mail.

ELAINE: Oh well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.

MRPITT: Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.

ELAINE: Alright. I can't go.













ELAINE: Um, the new Time magazine, the new People....

MRPITT: Oh, who's on the cover?






DOORMANGUY: Hey, buddy.

JERRY: You? What, what're you doing here? You work at this building too?

DOORMANGUY: Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?

JERRY: So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?

DOORMANGUY: You got a problem with that?

JERRY: Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.



DOORMANGUY: You really think you're better than me, don't you?!






GEORGE: My father opened his shirt...

JERRY: Yeah, and?

GEORGE: Tell him, Kramer.

KRAMER: He had breasts.



JERRY: What do you mean, breasts?

GEORGE: Big breasts!

JERRY: So what? A lot of older men have that.

KRAMER: No, not these. These were real hooters.



GEORGE: I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.

KRAMER: Well, maybe you're gonna get them too, George.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?

JERRY: But, your father's not bald.

GEORGE: No no no, that skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.

JERRY: Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.



KRAMER: You know Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.

GEORGE: You mean like a bra?

KRAMER: A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.

JERRY: Boy, that brain never stops working does it?

KRAMER: I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.





BUXOMWOMAN: Hey, we're twins.

GEORGE: What!?

BUXOMWOMAN: Our shirts. They're the same.

GEORGE: Oh, huh, imagine that.



ELAINE: What? What'd you say to the doorman?

JERRY: What? Nothing.

ELAINE: He claims that you followed him home and started harassing him.

JERRY: What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What did I do to him? Because I asked him about the Knicks?

ELAINE: Hey, did you make the movie?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.

JERRY: Alright. Can we go to a later show so he's off his shift when I come by?

ELAINE: Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?

JERRY: Yes, we do.



ELAINE: What is wrong with George?

JERRY: He's... trying to get something off his chest.



GEORGE: Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.






DOORMANGUY: Help you?

JERRY: Oh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.

DOORMANGUY: I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back like people in your world.

JERRY: Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.

DOORMANGUY: You wanna be friends?

JERRY: I'd like to be.

DOORMANGUY: Then watch the door for a minute, would you?



JERRY: What?

DOORMANGUY: Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.

JERRY: What? Wait, wait a second. What do I do?

DOORMANGUY: It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And if they don't live here don't let them in.



DOORMANGUY: Here.



DOORMANGUY: Wear that.

JERRY: Oh.



JERRY: Hey hey, wait a second. Hey! Hello!



JERRY: Hey hey, wait a second. You live here?

MRGREEN: Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.



JERRY: You think you're better than me?











DELIVERYGUY: You have to sign for it.

JERRY: Oh, right.



DELIVERYGUY: Hey, how about those Knicks, huh?



JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah.








KRAMER: Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.

FRANK: Thank you, Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah.

FRANK: Put it over there.



KRAMER: So, how you feeling?

FRANK: Tired.

KRAMER: Uh huh. Your back hurt?

FRANK: How did you know?

KRAMER: Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.

FRANK: Up here?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, top floor. Listen Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now look at this.



KRAMER: Mind you, this is just a prototype.



FRANK: You want me to wear a bra?!

KRAMER: No no. A bra is for ladies.



KRAMER: Meet... the bro.






ESTELLE: So, is your father excited about coming home?



ESTELLE: George?

GEORGE: Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?

ESTELLE: All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?

GEORGE: Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.

ESTELLE: She was a lovely woman.

GEORGE: Yeah? What about physically?

ESTELLE: Physically?

GEORGE: Yeah, you know, what did she uh, look like?

ESTELLE: Well, you've seen pictures.

GEORGE: You can't tell much from those pictures.

ESTELLE: So what?

GEORGE: Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?

ESTELLE: Big? No, just my height.

GEORGE: Bosomy?

ESTELLE: Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!

GEORGE: No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.

ESTELLE: Where do you get your genes from?!

GEORGE: That's what I'd like to know.






ELAINE: I can't believe you left your post.

JERRY: He left me there. You see the mind games?





ELAINE: Hey, what's up? What's going on here?

TENANTONE: Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.



TENANTTWO: Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?

ELAINE: Jerry, let's get out of here.

JERRY: Yeah.








ESTELLE: Oh my God!






ELAINE: What were you doing watching the door anyway?

JERRY: He asked me to. We were getting along.

ELAINE: You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt. Jerry, I'm in this too deep.

JERRY: Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!

ELAINE: Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.

JERRY: Alright, well what if we say...

ELAINE: Alright, here it is. This is what we'll tell them. You came to pick me up.

JERRY: I came to pick you up.

ELAINE: Yeah. That's what I just said.

JERRY: I know. I was just...

ELAINE: Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.

JERRY: Alright, well. Just start again then.

ELAINE: Okay, you came to pick me up at...

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: You see? Again.

JERRY: What? I said right.



ELAINE: Alright, you came right upstairs without talking to the doorman.

JERRY: But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.

ELAINE: So what? No one's gonna believe a doorman!

JERRY: But I don't know if this is gonna work.

ELAINE: Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Good. Now fix me a drink.






KRAMER: How's that feel?

FRANK: This feels very comfortable.

KRAMER: You see?

FRANK: I feel ten years younger.

KRAMER: Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.



FRANK: And I can breathe easier, too.

KRAMER: I told you! Now Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?

FRANK: Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.

KRAMER: Here's our chance. What do you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.

FRANK: Let's do it!



FRANK: Except, we gotta do something about the name.

KRAMER: Why, what's wrong with bro?

FRANK: No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.

KRAMER: Alright, you got something better?

FRANK: How about uh... the mansiere?

KRAMER: Mansiere?

FRANK: That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?



GEORGE: Well you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.

FRANK: Hey George, what do you like better? The bro or the mansiere?



GEORGE: Dad. We need to talk.






DOORMANGUY: I had to use the bathroom so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.



MRSPAYTON: Why should I believe you?

DOORMANGUY: Actually, it was her friend.



MRSPAYTON: I was just speaking to the doorman here about the couch robbery.



ELAINE: Oh really? The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?

MRSPAYTON: He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.

ELAINE: Oh my, well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?



DOORMANGUY: Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package...



DOORMANGUY: ...at the exact same time the couch was stolen.



ELAINE: He never watched a door before, Mrs. Payton. He didn't know how to do it. You know, he's a comedian, Mrs. Payton. They don't know how to do anything.



ELAINE: Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mind games.








JERRY: You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?

ELAINE: There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.

JERRY: Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!

ELAINE: Is it possible we were victims of a sting?

JERRY: I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.







DOORMANTWO: So, you didn't even watch the couch?

DOORMANGUY: No. I was just messing with his head.

DOORMANTWO: And they think they're better than us?







ELAINE: Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?



ELAINE: We have to replace the couch.

JERRY: Now we have to buy a new couch?!



GEORGE: Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?

JERRY: The one with the Poppie stain?!

GEORGE: Yeah, sure. Then my father will have no place to sleep. He's gotta move out.

ELAINE: But it's got a pee stain on it.

GEORGE: No, the cushion's turned over.

ELAINE: I guess.

GEORGE: Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!






KRAMER: Now, it's called the bro.

FRANK: Or the mansiere.

KRAMER: Yeah, but I prefer the bro.

FRANK: I like mansiere.



FARKUS: Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.

KRAMER: Yeah.

FARKUS: You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilizing fifty percent of the market.

FRANK: That's what we figured, huh?

KRAMER: I told you.

FARKUS: And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.

FRANK: I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.



FARKUS: So uh, what do you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?

KRAMER: Uh.

FRANK: Definitely Velcro.



KRAMER: Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.



KRAMER: I think we've all experienced that.



FARKUS: Summer nights.



KRAMER: Very funny.

FARKUS: Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont.

KRAMER: Of course, yes.

FARKUS: But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.



FARKUS: Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.



FRANK: Oh, thank you Sid. But that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.

FARKUS: I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you if I were to ask her out?

FRANK: You wanna go out with my wife?! Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!

FARKUS: Oh no, Frank, I was just saying...



FRANK: I know what you're saying and I know what you're thinking!!

FARKUS: No, Frank...

FRANK: Come on Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.



KRAMER: Frank!






GEORGE: Jerry took the couch back.

FRANK: He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?

GEORGE: Oh, I pleaded with him.

FRANK: Where am I supposed to sleep?

GEORGE: Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. Mom's coming to get you.

KRAMER: I thought Jerry didn't want that couch because of the stain?



FRANK: What stain?

KRAMER: Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee stain.



FRANK: You had me sleeping on a pee stained couch?

GEORGE: No no no no. The cushion was turned over.

FRANK: But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!



GEORGE: Ah! There's mom, there's mom.



ESTELLE: Is it safe to come in?

GEORGE: Oh, of course. Of course.

ESTELLE: You're not having any of your transvestite parties?

FRANK: Will you stop it?

ESTELLE: I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!



FRANK: Here Cosmo.

KRAMER: Oh, hey.

FRANK: You can have the hi-fi. I don't need it now.

KRAMER: Alright, I got it.

FRANK: I got one at home.



ESTELLE: Alright, let's go.



FRANK: We'll go out for dinner tonight.

ESTELLE: I can't tonight, I'm busy.

FRANK: What do you mean, busy?

ESTELLE: I'm having dinner with someone.

FRANK: With whom?



ESTELLE: Sid Farkus.

FRANK: Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.



ESTELLE: Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear them.

FRANK: Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!



GEORGE: But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!

FRANK: We'll work something out.








GERMANWOMAN: Stop him! Ja ja ja, it's him!



GERMANWOMAN: Stop that man! It's him.



GERMANWOMAN: Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him.



HORST: Hey hey. That record player is not yours.

KRAMER: Now look, somebody gave it to me.

HORST: You're a thief. We have proof.



HORST: What is that?



KRAMER: The first upper body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.



HORST: How does it connect in the back? With a hook?

KRAMER: Oh no no. Here, Velcro.



HORST: Oh, keine problem, ah?



HORST: Is gut, ja?






MRSPAYTON: Well, I suppose it'll have to do.

ELAINE: It's a beautiful couch.

JERRY: It's hardly been used.



JERRY: Poppie!

POPPIE: Oh, hello Jerry.

JERRY: What're you doing here?

POPPIE: Visiting my friend.

JERRY: Oh. Hey, how you feeling?

POPPIE: Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.

JERRY: Hmm.

POPPIE: So, I sell the restaurant, huh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, that's aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated was in the restaurant with your friend.



POPPIE: She start the big fight about abortion.



POPPIE: It's you! It's you!

ELAINE: What?

POPPIE: You! I... I gotta sit down!



JERRY: No, Poppie! No!!








FRANK: Kasha?



GEORGE: No. Thanks, dad.
