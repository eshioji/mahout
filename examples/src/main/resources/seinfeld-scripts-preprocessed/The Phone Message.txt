You never see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face. Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people, where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? "We have soda! We have soda! We have soda!" Jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV and you're drinking the exact product that they're advertising right there on TV? And it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jet skiing, girls in bikinis. And I'm standing there, "Maybe I'm putting too much ice in mine."




GEORGE: So then, as we were leaving we're just kind of standing there. And she was sort of smiling at me and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out. Because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it as like they're psychotic or something. I don't know if I'm supposed to smile back. I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like, remember how Quayle looked when Bentsen gave him that Kennedy line? That's what I looked like.

JERRY: So you didn't ask?

GEORGE: No, I froze.



JERRY: Counter.

GEORGE: So wait, wait. Half hour later, I'm back in my office, I tell Lloyd the whole story and he says, "So why don't you call her?" I says, "I can't." I couldn't. I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I've got to get into a mental state, like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So then Lloyd calls me a wuss.

JERRY: He said wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.

JERRY: So you called?

GEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness, I started eating an apple. Because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, makes you sound casual.

JERRY: Yeah, like a farm boy.

GEORGE: Right. So I call her up. I tell her it's me. She gives me an enthusiastic, "Hi."

JERRY: Oh, an enthusiastic hi, that's beautiful.

GEORGE: Oh, if I don't get the enthusiastic hi, I'm out of there.

JERRY: Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi. Go ahead.

GEORGE: So we start talking, I don't like to go too long before I ask them out. I want to get it over with right away so I just blurt out, "What are you doing Saturday night?"

JERRY: And?

GEORGE: She bought.

JERRY: Great day in the morning.

GEORGE: Then, I got off the phone right away.

JERRY: Sure, it's like robbing a bank. You don't loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You make your hit and get out.

GEORGE: It's amazing. We, we, we both have dates the same night. I can't remember the last time that happened.




GEORGE: I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of underwear.

CAROL: You do not.

GEORGE: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way I only have to do wash once a year. 






JERRY: Come on try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.

DONNA: That's Irish.

JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, Lassie?




CAROL: So uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.

GEORGE: Yeah. We should do this again.

CAROL: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?

GEORGE: Oh, no thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night. It keeps me up.

CAROL: Oh. So um... okay.

GEORGE: Okay.



CAROL: Good night.

GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.






DONNA: Thanks again for the movie.

JERRY: You're welcome.

DONNA: I'd invite you up but the place is being painted.

JERRY: Oh, that's okay.

DONNA: Unless you want to go to your place?

JERRY: Okay, but there's no cake or anything if that's what you're looking for.




GEORGE: Take it easy. Take it easy.




JERRY: I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was brought up.

DONNA: Values are important.

JERRY: Oh, so important. So uh, what are you doing Thursday night? You want to have dinner?

DONNA: Thursday's great.

JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don't feel comfortable in them.

DONNA: Are those cotton Dockers?

JERRY: Oh! I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.

DONNA: Really? I like that commercial.



JERRY: You like that commercial?

DONNA: Yeah, it's clever.

JERRY: Now, wait a second. You mean the one where those guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?

DONNA: Yeah, that's the one.

JERRY: What could you possibly like about that?

DONNA: I don't know. I like the guys.

JERRY: Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other. And I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

DONNA: I know guys like that. To me, the dialogue rings true.

JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if somehow, somewhere, men actually talked like that, what does that have anything to do with the pants?! Doesn't that bother you?

DONNA: That's the idea! That is what is clever about it, that they're not talking about the pants!

JERRY: But they're talking about nothing!

DONNA: That's the point!

JERRY: I know the point!

DONNA: No one's telling you to like it!

JERRY: I mean all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that suppose to be?






JERRY: What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because, whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. Like, the guy will be like, "I don't think her eyebrows are uneven. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?" And, of course, the woman's looking at the guy thinking, "What is he looking at? Do I want someone looking at me like this for the rest of my life?"




JERRY: I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with somebody that actually likes this commercial?

ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean enough.

JERRY: No kidding? Did you tell him that was the reason?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there! They were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.



ELAINE: Hi.



JERRY: You're still thinking about this?

GEORGE: She invites me up at twelve o'clock at night for coffee and I don't go up. "No thank you, I don't want coffee. It keeps me up. It's too late for me to drink coffee." I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think of me.

JERRY: She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.

GEORGE: She invited me up! Coffee's not coffee! Coffee is sex.

ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.

GEORGE: Coffee's coffee in the morning. It's not coffee at twelve o'clock at night.

ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.

GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD who are on twenty-four hour missile watch! And everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny. I kept saying to myself, "Keep it up. Don't blow it. You're doing great."

ELAINE: It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.

GEORGE: I can't call her now. It's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.

ELAINE: Why? I love it when guys call me the next day.

GEORGE: Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, "Uh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." If I call her now, she's gonna thing I'm too needy. Women don't want to see need. They want a take charge guy. A colonel, a kaiser, a czar.

ELAINE: All she'll think is that you like her.

GEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!

ELAINE: She wants you to like her!

GEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her. If she likes me! But she doesn't like me.

ELAINE: I don't know what your parents did to you. 



KRAMER: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act! Alright, you're up and you're on stage and you go uh, "Hey uh, did you ever notice how uh, cars here in uh, New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore? Someone's in a life and death situation and we're thinking, "Well, sorry buddy. Should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelet's and sausages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years."  



KRAMER: So, you gonna use it?

JERRY: I don't think so. 

KRAMER: What? It's funny. 

ELAINE: It's funny. 

JERRY: I, I like to do my own material. 

KRAMER: That's as good as anything you do. 

GEORGE: Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out. Come on. 

JERRY: Why do we have to leave? 

GEORGE: Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let's go.

ELAINE: Oh, see. This is the problem. 

JERRY: You're kicking me out of my house? 

GEORGE: Yes. 

ELAINE: Don't forget.



GEORGE: Oh uh, Jerry? Do you have any apples?

JERRY: Don't do the apples. It's enough already with the apples.





CAROL:  Hi, it's Carol. I'll get back to you. 

GEORGE: Um, hi. It's uh, George, George Costanza. Remember me? The guy that didn't come up for coffee. You see, I, I didn't realize that coffee didn't really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was um, it was fun. So um, so you call me back, if you want. That's up to you. You know, whatever you want to do. Either way, the ball's in your court. So uh, take it easy.





JERRY: I'm just going to get my jacket. I'll meet you downstairs. What's the matter? Did you call? 

GEORGE: Got her machine. I'm dead. I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead. I'm a dead man. Dead man.

JERRY: What did you say? 

GEORGE: I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine! The little light is blinking right now. "Come and listen to the idiot! Hey, everybody! The idiots on!"

JERRY: After one date you try and improvise on a machine?

GEORGE: Now I'm in the worst position of all.

ELAINE: You know, my brother in law once left a message on this guy's machine and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to and it would've cost him fifteen thousand dollars. So he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy came home, he went upstairs with him and switched the tape.

GEORGE: He did that?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Somebody did that?

JERRY: She'll call you back. You're overreacting.

GEORGE: I left a ball in her court.




JERRY: Not once.

DONNA: Never?

JERRY: I have never seen one episode of "I Love Lucy" in my life, ever.

DONNA: That's amazing.

JERRY: Thank you. 

DONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?

JERRY: Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.

DONNA: Really?

JERRY: I have no patience for lactose and I won't stand for it. Um, I'll be right back.



GEORGE: Wait till you hear this!



GEORGE: Woah, uh, I'm sorry. I, I didn't, I had no idea.



DONNA: Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom.

GEORGE: Oh well, I just wanted to talk to him for a minute. But I'll come back.

DONNA: You don't have to leave.

GEORGE: You sure?

DONNA: Yes.

GEORGE: Okay.

DONNA: I'm Donna.



GEORGE: Donna. Oh, you're the one who likes the commercial.

DONNA: He told you that?

GEORGE: No, he didn't actually tell me that uh, we were talking about that commercial. In fact, I think I brought it up because I like the commercial. No, he would never actually tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything. He's, he's like a clam. You're, you're not gonna mention this to him?



DONNA: So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip because I like that commercial?

JERRY: What? What did you say?

GEORGE: Say? What? Nothing. I didn't...

DONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.

JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?

DONNA: So you didn't have to tell your friends.

JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends. My friends don't have to tell you. 

GEORGE: Why did you have to get me in trouble?

DONNA: I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.

GEORGE: Boy, oh boy.

JERRY: I said I couldn't believe you like that commercial, so what?

DONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week and all of them liked the commercial.

JERRY: Boy, I'll bet you got a regular Algonquin Round Table there.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.

KRAMER: Oh. Oh!



KRAMER: Cotton Dockers!

GEORGE: Hello. Alright, we should be going. Come on.

KRAMER: What? What's going on?

DONNA: Don't bother. Don't bother. I'm leaving.



JERRY: Donna, really, you're making too much of this.

KRAMER: One hundred percent cotton Dockers. If they're not Dockers, they're just pants.

JERRY: Kramer, please... Donna.

DONNA: I don't want to hear it.



GEORGE: I can't believe I said that. You know me. I'm a vault!

JERRY: Don't worry about it. It wasn't working anyway.

KRAMER: What happened there?

JERRY: I'll tell you later.

GEORGE: You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.




GEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday? She doesn't call back. I call again Monday. I leave another message. I call Tuesday. I get the machine again, "I know you're there, I don't know what your story is." Yesterday, I'm a volcano. I try one more call, the machine comes on and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony. "Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days?! I don't like coffee! I don't have to come up! I'd like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I can spit it in your face!"

JERRY: You said that?

GEORGE: I lost it.

JERRY: I can't blame you. I, I can't believe she never called you back.

GEORGE: She did. Today.

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke and she's using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for it.

JERRY: So she didn't get the messages?

GEORGE: Exactly. But they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to see me. We're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.

JERRY: But what about the messages?



JERRY: Elaine's thing? How are you going to get in?

GEORGE: I'll meet her outside the building.

JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right for that machine.

GEORGE: Unless she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I kidding? I can't do this. I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those stupid machines.

JERRY: There's nothing to it. You just lift the lid, it comes right out.

GEORGE: You do it for me.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Come on, it'll be much easier.

JERRY: How are you going to get me up there?

GEORGE: I'll tell her I bumped into you, and I'm giving you a ride uptown.

JERRY: And who makes the switch?

GEORGE: You do.

JERRY: I do?

GEORGE: I can't do it. I'll keep her busy.

JERRY: I can't get involved in this.

GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.

JERRY: What if she sees me?

GEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.

JERRY: A wuss? Did you call me a wuss?




GEORGE: Well, there is traffic. It might take her till eight fifteen.

JERRY: I got one problem. You're going to keep her busy in the other room. Now what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she's coming.

GEORGE: A signal. Alright um, okay uh, okay the signal is I'll call out, "Tippy toe!"  

JERRY: Tippy toe? I don't think so. 

GEORGE: You don't like tippy toe?   

JERRY: No tippy toe.  

GEORGE: Alright uh, okay I got it. Um, I'll sing.

JERRY: What song?

GEORGE: Uh, "How do you solve a problem like Maria?"

JERRY: What is that?

GEORGE: Oh, it's a lovely song. "How do you solve a problem like Maria."

JERRY: Got anything else?

GEORGE: You pick it.

JERRY: "Lemon Tree."

GEORGE: Peter, Paul and Mary?

JERRY: No, Trina Lopez.

JERRY: "Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet."

GEORGE: "Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet."

GEORGE: You go the tapes?



JERRY: Standard, micro.

GEORGE: How do you feel? Confident?

JERRY: I feel good.

GEORGE: You nervous?

JERRY: Not at all.

GEORGE: Get up, get up! That's her! Oh, the hell with this! I'm scared to death! Just walk away! It's off. Cancel everything! Go!



CAROL:  Hi. What are you doing here? I though I was suppose to call you when I got home?

GEORGE: I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you. 

CAROL: Oh, that's sweet.



GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him right around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? Funny thing is I see him all the time.

JERRY: All the time.

CAROL: It's nice to meet you. 

JERRY: Hi.



CAROL: So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?

GEORGE: You know we could go uptown and that way we could give Jerry a ride.

CAROL: Okay, let's go. I'm ready. Where'd you park?

GEORGE: Don't you want to go upstairs first?

CAROL: No, what for? I'll just give the bag to the doorman.



JERRY: You know I really need to use the bathroom.

CAROL: Oh, well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, but I have to make a call, so...

CAROL: Well, they have a phone.

GEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.

CAROL: You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.

GEORGE: Right, right.




CAROL: The bathroom's down the hall to the right.

JERRY: Uh, you know, why don't you go first? You just had a long trip.

CAROL: No. I'm fine.

JERRY: You know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.

CAROL: Well that's weird.

GEORGE: Uh, no no, that can happen. I've read about that in medical journals. It's a freak thing.

CAROL: Well,  let me just check my messages and we'll go.

GEORGE: Uh Carol, could I talk to you for a second?



GEORGE: Right now.

CAROL: Sure.

GEORGE: Please. This is, this is very important.


 
GEORGE: Uh, tippy toe, tippy toe! Uh, lemon tree!



CAROL: Now I know who you are! You're a comedian. I've seen you. It's been driving me crazy!

JERRY: Right. I am.

GEORGE: Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment if you wouldn't mind and then we'll talk to Jerry.



JERRY: Hey you two, I'm ready to go.



CAROL: That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?

GEORGE: Don't you find that strange?

JERRY: Yes. 

CAROL: Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go.



CAROL: Nope, nothing here. Let's go.



CAROL: Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today, my neighbor called me and played my messages for me over the phone.

GEORGE: Oh, I...

CAROL: Yours were hilarious! We were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.






JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go, "Excuse me, I'm not in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away." I also have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much. Because you can't slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone, "You can't talk to me like that, bang." You know, cordless phone, "You can't talk to me like that."



JERRY: "I told her."
