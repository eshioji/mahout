

MRTHOMASSOULO: George, you're not really handicapped, are you?

GEORGE: I've had my difficulties.

MRTHOMASSOULO: I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that two hundred pound motorized cart with one hand.

GEORGE: Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?

MRTHOMASSOULO: No.

GEORGE: How about the old Spider Man live action show?

MRTHOMASSOULO: George, I've realized we've signed a one year contract with you, but at this point I think its best that we both go our separate ways.

GEORGE: I don't understand.

MRTHOMASSOULO: We don't like you. We want you to leave.

GEORGE: Clearer.




JERRY: So you're staying at Play Now?

GEORGE: Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.

JERRY: But they not you aren't handicapped, aren't you ashamed?

GEORGE: They're the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.



ELAINE: Hey

JERRY: Hello!

GEORGE: Hello Elaine!

ELAINE: What's that?

JERRY: Oh, it's just this stupid thing.

ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it's stupid. It's not about me, is it?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Not at all.

ELAINE: Tell me!

JERRY: Alright. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.

ELAINE: How is it talking?

JERRY: Well, her belly button is like a mouth. I'm bored. Talk to me.

ELAINE: Oh, I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.



JERRY: Hey, look whose here. Puddy.

ELAINE: My Puddy? But we broke up.

JERRY: And yet he continues to live.



PUDDY: Hey Benes, how are you?

ELAINE: I'm doing great.

PUDDY: Great. See you.

JERRY: Well, that's it. You two are back together.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.

ELAINE: David and I will not be getting back together.

JERRY: Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can't do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times and then it goes over.

GEORGE: That's beautiful.

ELAINE: What about you? You were even engaged and you cut it off just like that.

JERRY: That's different. I didn't have feelings for those people. But you, you'll backslide

ELAINE: You want to bet?

JERRY: Stakes?

ELAINE: Fifty.

JERRY: Dollars?

ELAINE: Alright. Witness?

GEORGE: Witness.

JERRY: Done.

GEORGE: Percentage?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: No.




CLAIRE: So I'll call you tonight?

JERRY: Yeah.

CLAIRE: What's wrong with the belt?

JERRY: I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So...



JERRY: ...that's it!

CLAIRE: So, you're insane?

JERRY: Oh yes, quite.



KRAMER: Hello!

JERRY: Of course it's a sliding scale.

CLAIRE: Catch you later.

KRAMER: Hello!

JERRY: Hello! La la la.

KRAMER: La la la.



KRAMER: Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.

JERRY: Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that's a good idea.

KRAMER: Of course it's a good idea, it's my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.

JERRY: Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don't own part or spending the two hundred million you don't have part?

KRAMER: You see I come up with these things, I know they're gold, but nothing happens. You know why?

JERRY: No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.

KRAMER: No, no time! It's all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?

JERRY: I can ball park it.



ELAINE: Hello!

KRAMER: Here we go, now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!

JERRY: Hey, I called you last night, where were you?

ELAINE: I went out with a, a friend.

JERRY: George?

ELAINE: No, no no.

JERRY: Well, I was here, that's everyone.



JERRY: Are those the same shoes as yesterday?

ELAINE: Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.

JERRY: Your hair, it's somewhat de-poofed.

ELAINE: It's the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?

JERRY: Wait a second, what's going on here?

ELAINE: Nothing, nothing.



JERRY: You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday! You saw Puddy!

KRAMER: Hoochie moochie.

JERRY: Hand it over. Pay up.

ELAINE: No! It's an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!

JERRY: Then what do you call it? People don't just bump into each other and have sex. This isn't Cinemax.

ELAINE: It was no big deal okay? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.

JERRY: Ah, dinner! That's it, you're all the way back!

ELAINE: Ugh!

JERRY: Sex, that's meaningless, I can understand that. But dinner, that's heavy. That's like an hour.

KRAMER: Man, two point nine percent financing on a Toyota. That was my idea too!




GEORGE: Good Morning!

COWORKER: Go to hell!

GEORGE: Hi Allison, that's a nice dress.

ALLISON: Don't even look at me.

GEORGE: Hey Glenn!

GLENN: Hey, go to hell!

GEORGE: Heard that one already.






KRAMER: So that's the bedroom. Here's the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen. Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.

JERRY: And you are?

DARIN: Oh hey, I'm Darin. I'm new here.

KRAMER: Yeah, that's Jerry, you don't have to worry about him. Why don't you go across the hall and get started on that mail.

DARIN: Right!

KRAMER: He's a go getter!

JERRY: Who's he?

KRAMER: My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.

JERRY: But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.

KRAMER: Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.

JERRY: Alright, it's time to go.

KRAMER: Jerry, it's not for people, it's for oil tankers.

JERRY: I know!



KRAMER: You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won't spill out.

JERRY: Actually, that is not a bad idea.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Now, it's time to go.





JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Hello.



JERRY: Hello. So, what's going on?

GEORGE: Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They've downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I'm like Hitler's last days here.

JERRY: So, are you going to leave?

GEORGE: Oh no! I'm vigilant. They'll never get me out. I'm like a weed, Jerry.

JERRY: I thought you're like Hitler in the bunker?

GEORGE: I'm a weed in Hitler's bunker.

JERRY: I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.



JERRY: I'm getting another call, see you. Hello?

DARIN: Hi, this is Darin from Kramer's office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk's coffee shop.

JERRY: Really? When?

DARIN: In ten minutes. Do you need directions?

JERRY: No, I don't.

DARIN: Well, I'll call back in five minutes to confirm.

KRAMER: Yeah, five.



ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hey! So, where's my money?

ELAINE: No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?

JERRY: Oh yeah, hold on.



JERRY: Hello Darin, this is Jerry from Jerry's office.



JERRY: We're going to be three for lunch. What do you mean he's already left?



JERRY: Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?

KRAMER: What? When did this happen?

JERRY: Well, just...

KRAMER: Darin!






ELAINE: I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy's. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I'll call.



ELAINE: Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That's funny. That's really funny. That's really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy.






GEORGE: Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.

JERRY: Do you have to write all this stuff down.

DARIN: Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lomez and he didn't want to miss anything.

JERRY: So, how hot did it get?

GEORGE: I don't know, a hundred and twenty, a hundred and thirty. Then they sent some guys to sandblast for six hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.

JERRY: I guess you can take anything but actual work.

GEORGE: Bring it on!



GEORGE: Hello Kramer!

JERRY: Welcome!

GEORGE: La la la.

KRAMER: Sorry I couldn't get out of there, what did I miss?

DARIN: Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

GEORGE: And I still say he's naked under there!

JERRY: Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

GEORGE: Oh, shut up!

DARIN: Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld's drink with his bare hands using it to wash up.



DARIN: Then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, "This never happened."








CLAIRE: What's so funny?

JERRY: Oh, nothing.

CLAIRE: What are you laughing about? Tell me.

JERRY: Oh alright, this is really dumb, really stupid. We've been doing this silly, dumb voice.



CLAIRE: So is it fun humiliating me?

JERRY: No, it's not you. It's your stomach, he's taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. Hello.

CLAIRE: So you think I'm fat?

JERRY: No it's...



DARIN: Mr. Kramer says, "Hey buddy!"

JERRY: Hey, we're kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?

DARIN: Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?

JERRY: Get out!

CLAIRE: I'm leaving too.

JERRY: Nobody said you're fat. He's a loving character, like the Kool-Aid guy.

CLAIRE: He is fat!

JERRY: No, he's just a little bloated.

CLAIRE: Good bye!

JERRY: It's mostly water weight.



KRAMER: Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.



DARIN: Mr. Kramer, Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.

KRAMER: Yeah, well nothing before noon.

JERRY: Line two?

KRAMER: Yeah, your phone is line one.

JERRY: Oh.




PUDDY: So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.

ELAINE: See, this is what Jerry's doesn't understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn't mean we are back together.

PUDDY: I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.

ELAINE: Yeah.

PUDDY: Not having to do all that, you know, work.

ELAINE: Well, either way.

PUDDY: All that calling you and buying you stuff�

ELAINE: David.

PUDDY: Caring about how everyone at work isn't as smart as you. It's brutal.

ELAINE: Alright that's it! We're back together!

PUDDY: Oh, no.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah.

PUDDY: Look Elaine, be reasonable.



ELAINE: Get those clothes off. You're going to spend the night and we're going to cuddle.

PUDDY: What?

ELAINE: You heard me. Strip!






GEORGE: Alright... okay.




GEORGE: Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him...



GEORGE: ...I'm in my office!! Thanks.




KRAMER: Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?

DEANJONES: I've been reviewing Darren's internship journal. Doing laundry?

KRAMER: Yeah.

DEANJONES: Mending chicken wire, high tea with a Mr. Newman?

KRAMER: I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.

DEANJONES: As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.

KRAMER: And with Darren's help, we'll get that chicken.

DEANJONES: I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darren to continue working with you.

KRAMER: Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.

DEANJONES: Your fly is open.






JERRY: So you're sure you're not still angry about last night?

CLAIRE: No, I'm fine. Just as long as you don't ever do that voice again.

JERRY: Never?

CLAIRE: Never.

JERRY: What about if you're not around?

CLAIRE: No!

JERRY: So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?

CLAIRE: That's right.

JERRY: I can do that.

CLAIRE: So what's your decision?

JERRY: I don't know.







CLAIRE: Jerry, hi.

JERRY: Hello. La la la.




GEORGE: You broke up with her? Why?

JERRY: So we could do the voice. La la la. What's the matter?

GEORGE: I think I'm getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La la la?

JERRY: No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. Hola. Hello.

GEORGE: I think I like the girl better than the voice.

JERRY: Really?



JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: Still?

GEORGE: I told you.

ELAINE: Alright, here you go, choke on it.



JERRY: See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.

ELAINE: Yeah, well not for long. I'm breaking up with him.

JERRY: No, I don't think so. I've seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It's kismet.

ELAINE: Double or nothing.

JERRY: Done.



GEORGE: Witness?

JERRY: You're in there again?

GEORGE: I think Play Now is putting something in my food.



ELAINE: Alright, I'm out of here.

JERRY: What is this?



KRAMER: I don't know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darin left I haven't been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I'm clueless.



KRAMER: Is that clock right?

JERRY: Yeah. Nine o'clock.

KRAMER: I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.

JERRY: Good bye Kramer.

KRAMER: Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: So played.

GEORGE: I told you.




KRAMER: Darin? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.

DARIN: I don't care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.

KRAMER: Kramerica is no more.

DARIN: What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.

KRAMER: Probably. Darin, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.





KRAMER: Well, you're still here?

DARIN: I haven't had time to leave.

KRAMER: Well, I haven't changed my mind.





KRAMER: Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I'll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let's get back to work!





KRAMER: Let's see what Jerry has to eat.




MRTHOMASSOULO: You win George. We've had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That's half of your entire contract. Please, just go.

GEORGE: You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.

MRTHOMASSOULO: Want to play hand ball huh? Fine.



MRTHOMASSOULO: Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza's handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.

GEORGE: Well played.

MRTHOMASSOULO: I'll see you in hell Costanza.




JERRY: Claire, thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second.



JERRY: So we definitely don't want to do the voice anymore?



JERRY: Alright, we're back together again, great. Bye bye.




KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Trouble down at the plant?

KRAMER: It's a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.

GEORGE: You have to drink that whole thing?

KRAMER: No no no, it's for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.

JERRY: I understand.

GEORGE: Would a giant rubber ball work?

KRAMER: Conceivably.

GEORGE: Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don't we test your bladder system at my office?

JERRY: You're not...

GEORGE: Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there's nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.




PUDDY: Hey, you want to split a root beer?

ELAINE: I don't think so David, we're through.

PUDDY: Oh, that's a nice sweater.






ELAINE: Whew, that was a dozy.




JERRY: Go again?

ELAINE: Book it.

GEORGE: Witness.




ELAINE: David I know this hurts, but it's the way it has to be.











ELAINE: I'm going to get some popcorn.




ELAINE: So, how did it end?

JERRY: They got away.

ELAINE: Uh.




ELAINE: Listen David, I've got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?




JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Did you bring the video camera?

JERRY: Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I'll see you.

GEORGE: Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.

JERRY: I can't. I got to meet Clare.

KRAMER: You gave up the voice?

JERRY: Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.

KRAMER: No.

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Darin?

DARIN: Sorry, Mr. Seinfeld.

JERRY: Uh, bathroom.

GEORGE: Hey, use mine. I'll let you in.

JERRY: I thought it was open to the public.

GEORGE: I uh, took care of that.




JERRY: Wow! Zanadu. No wonder you're putting in so many hours.



JERRY: May I?

GEORGE: I insist. I'll fix us a drink.



GEORGE: I got it.




KRAMER: Whew. You know Darin, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would've said you're crazy. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out the window.




GEORGE: So, check out my view.



JERRY: Wow! Hey, there's Clare. I better go down.

GEORGE: Hey, there's Kramer and Darin.

JERRY: There's the giant ball of oil. Clare's right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello! Hello! Hello!




CLAIRE: I don't believe this. I am not looking up if you're going to do that voice.




KRAMER: Bombs away.




JERRY: This is going to be a shame.



GEORGE: Hello.




KRAMER: Well, that didn't work. Hey, how about this? Ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?

DARIN: Oh that sounds interesting sir.

KRAMER: Yeah.






JERRY: Claire won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you're not going in anymore.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: So they're not paying you your...

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: So you're pretty much...

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: What ever happened to Darin?

KRAMER: Darin is going away for a long long time.

JERRY: So Claire sure looked real funny covered in oil like that. Hello I got beamed with a giant ball of oil.

GEORGE: I'm slippery as an eel.

KRAMER: La la la.

JERRY: I'm just so glad it's back.




ELAINE: See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.

PUDDY: I want to break up.

ELAINE: Ah nuts!
