

ELLEN: So, they have this clock now where you punch in your age and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live.

JERRY: So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest and you're going ten, nine, eight... I told you this thing was good!



ELLEN: I can't believe this is our first date.

JERRY: I know. How about dessert?

ELLEN: I suppose I have to get a piece of cake.

JERRY: Why?

ELLEN: Today's my birthday.

JERRY: What? Today? Really?

ELLEN: Yeah.






GEORGE: So, she went out with you on a first date and it was her birthday?

JERRY: Yeah. And she picked the day!

GEORGE: Is she socially awkward?

JERRY: No, she's great! She's attractive and fun.

GEORGE: Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.

JERRY: She's not Lincoln.



KRAMER: Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?

JERRY: I'll pass.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? Huh. Hey, George! Pizza? Yum yum!

GEORGE: Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross scholarship.

JERRY: Does it ever bother you that this organization...

GEORGE: Nope!

JERRY: ...is beating the bushes...

GEORGE: Nope!



JERRY: ...to basically give this money away...

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: ...to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?

GEORGE: I'm fine with it! Fine I say!






STUDENTONE: And then I received a seven hundred and forty on the English achievement test.



GEORGE: Quick, what's your favorite animal?

STUDENTONE: I, I don't know... frog?

GEORGE: A frog?

STUDENTONE: Well, I...

GEORGE: Frog is wrong.





GEORGE: I see here that you play the harp.



GEORGE: Tell me, why do you have to tilt it?



GEORGE: Can't you just build it on an angle? Save you a lot of trouble.

STUDENTTWO: Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands of years...

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. We'll uh, let you know.





GEORGE: I see your GPA is a four point oh.

STUDENTTHREE: You like that, don't you?





GEORGE: So uh, Steven, I see you're president of the chess club.

STEVEN: State champs.

GEORGE: Who's your favorite chess player?

STEVEN: Nastercoff?

GEORGE: Right. Nastercoff. What country is he from again?

STEVEN: I don't know. I made it up.



STEVEN: I'm never gonna get this thing.

GEORGE: Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you telling me for? You really had me going there! Come on, sit down.



GEORGE: What do you want to do when you grow up?

STEVEN: I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect.






ELAINE: So get this, Mr. Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.

JERRY: Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: Hey!

KRAMER: Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's loading up my slice at the fixings bar. Garlic. 


KRAMER: And what not. Mmm, mmm. And I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye.



KRAMER: So I give him the crook-eye back, you know.



KRAMER: Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!

JERRY: The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know.



KRAMER: They block it! So I lunged for the bathroom.



KRAMER: I grab the knob, occupado! Then they back me up against the cartoon map of Italy.



KRAMER: And all of the sudden they just stop.

ELAINE: What? What happened?

KRAMER: Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker. Yeah, like this.



KRAMER: I'm only showing eight fingers.

JERRY: Well, what does that mean?

KRAMER: That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was the eighth president.



KRAMER: They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!






ELLEN: Oh Jerry, can you hold on a second? I just want to check my messages.



ELLEN: Oh, Melissa! Kim!

MELISSA: Ellen.

ELLEN: Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry.

MELISSA: Oh, we've heard a lot about you! It is so sweet of you to take her out.

KIM: Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.

JERRY: She coming of a bad break up?

KIM: No.

MELISSA: See you!



JERRY: Any messages?

ELLEN: Yeah, no one called.




JERRY: They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.

GEORGE: So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of, like us with Elaine.



JERRY: There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.

GEORGE: Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?

JERRY: No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!

GEORGE: Hey, I think I may have found someone for the scholarship.

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers. Finally, this kid walks in, Steven Koren, a regular guy. Likes sports, watches TV.

JERRY: Is he smart?

GEORGE: He knows how to read. And he also knows that finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this, he's into architecture.

JERRY: Hey! Just like you pretend to be.

GEORGE: Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.

JERRY: I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!






ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.



PETERMAN: Oh it's just a place to flop.



ELAINE: Well, what part of your life...



ELAINE: ...do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?

PETERMAN: Oh Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day to day life.

ELAINE: Oh.



PETERMAN: Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again. Just when I finally memorized them.

ELAINE: Well, Mr. Peterman, do you want to, um...

PETERMAN: Two... CBS...

ELAINE: ...get um, started...

PETERMAN: Three. I don't know what that is. Where's my damn preview channel?

ELAINE: Well I, I got to tell you Mr. Peterman I don't know if I see a whole book here.

PETERMAN: Well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?

ELAINE: You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?

PETERMAN: You don't say?

ELAINE: Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.

PETERMAN: Well, that's pretty exciting. Let's put that in the book.

ELAINE: But that didn't happen to you.

PETERMAN: So, we pay off your friend and it becomes a Peterman.

ELAINE: No I, I really don't think you can do that.



PETERMAN: Oh damn. I forgot to buy plant food again. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. 


ELAINE: You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.






JERRY: Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?

ELLEN: No, this is brand new. Do you like it?

JERRY: Actually, yeah. Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!

ELLEN: No Jerry, the waitress game be another one.

JERRY: I guess that's all right.

ELLEN: Is something wrong, Jerry?

JERRY: No, absolutely nothing.



JERRY: You're fantastic!



JERRY: Hey guys!

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Kramer, George, this is Ellen.






GEORGE: Ladies and gentlemen, this...



GEORGE: ...is Steven Koren. His GPA is a solid two point oh! Right in that meaty part of the curve, not showing off, not falling behind.

WYCK: George, the qualifications for this scholarship were suppose to be largely academic.

GEORGE: I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests.

WYCK: These aren't standardized tests, these are his grades.

GEORGE: Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be... an architect.

WYCK: Is that right?

STEVEN: Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.

GEORGE: Steven, nothing is higher than...



GEORGE: ...architect.

STEVEN: I think I'd really like to be a city planner.



STEVEN: Why limit myself to one building when I can design a whole city?

WYCK: Well, that's a good point.

GEORGE: No, it's not.

STEVEN: Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop out with a tilty desk and a big ruler?



GEORGE: It's called a T square.

WYCK: You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect after he flunked out of dental school!



WYCK: Congratulations, young man.



STEVEN: Thank you.

WYCK: Susan would be very proud of what you're doing.

STEVEN: Thank you.








KRAMER: And they made it their sign because Van Buren, our eighth President, was the man they most admired.

PETERMAN: Kramer my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.



KRAMER: You know, if you like that one I got more. What are you looking for? Romance? Uh, comedy? Adventure? Erotica?



ELAINE: No uh, Kramer. I don't think...

PETERMAN: How much would you take for the whole lot?

KRAMER: My whole lot?

PETERMAN: Name your price, man!

KRAMER: Fifteen hundred dollars.

PETERMAN: I'll give you half that.

KRAMER: Done!

PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend, consider Elaine at your disposal.

KRAMER: Okay. Well, I uh, I like to work in the evenings.








ELAINE: Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Sacamano story?!

KRAMER: Well, I'm on the phone with Bob and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.

ELAINE: What happened to Bob Sacamano?

KRAMER: Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.



KRAMER: So I'm waiting for the subway, it's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.

ELAINE: Alright, well now that's something.

KRAMER: Well, I don't know if I lost track of time or what, but the next think I knew.

ELAINE: A train is bearing down on you?!

KRAMER: No, I slipped and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.

ELAINE: I don't understand. You were wearing the pants you were returning?

KRAMER: Well, I guess I was.

ELAINE: What were you gonna wear on the way back?

KRAMER: Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! Alright, next story.

ELAINE: Alright, I think I got enough for one day.

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, chew on that.

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll chew on that.

KRAMER: Oh hey, listen, by the way, I'm hosting a little get together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.

ELAINE: Oh thanks, I've got plans.

KRAMER: Elaine, you should be there to document it.

ELAINE: Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends and you want me to take notes?

KRAMER: Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the people a chance to loosen up.






JERRY: So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?

GEORGE: I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father, my father's father before him.

JERRY: You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.



JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel. We're all set for the weekend.

GEORGE: You're spending the weekend with Ellen?

JERRY: Vermont! With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to!



JERRY: Four days at a beautiful bed and breakfast! I can't wait. Bye bye.



JERRY: What?



JERRY: What is this?



GEORGE: You want to start?

KRAMER: Uh, no no no, you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.

GEORGE: Jerry, this whole Ellen situation has gone far enough.

JERRY: What?!

KRAMER: Jerry, she's a loser.



JERRY: Where is this coming from? She's great!

GEORGE: Why are you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things are gonna pick up.

JERRY: There's nothing wrong with my career!

KRAMER: Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.

GEORGE: I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!

KRAMER: Well, you know I think it's something he should consider.

GEORGE: Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!

KRAMER: Listen George, all these issues are interrelated.

JERRY: Alright! Excuse me! I'm not buying any of this!

KRAMER: Alright, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!

JERRY: You know, this is like that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up and he's the same but everyone else is different!

KRAMER: Which one?

JERRY: They were all like that!






STEVEN: Why did you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?

GEORGE: Well Steven, I uh...



STEVEN: These are my new friends, The Van Buren Boys.

GANGMEMBERONE: He became so disillusioned he had to join us.

GEORGE: Oh, nice.

STEVEN: I want my scholarship back so I can be a city planner.

GEORGE: What about architect, Steven?

GANGMEMBERONE: City planner.






LOMEZ: Great party, K man!

KRAMER: Yeah, well you got that straight! Hey Elaine, try the beef, because that's really au jus sauce, huh. Real au jus sauce!

ELAINE: I'll make a note of it.

LOMEZ: Hey Kramer?

KRAMER: Yeah?

LOMEZ: Ramirez has never heard your pants story.

KRAMER: Oh okay! Well, you know I had Bob Sacamano on the phone and I suddenly realized that I...



ELAINE: You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.

KRAMER: What do you mean?

ELAINE: You signed the release.

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: He sat in mud. Not you.

KRAMER: But I did sit in mud.

ELAINE: You didn't! You never sat in mud!

KRAMER: I was all dirty!

ELAINE: It never happened! Understand?



KRAMER: Hey hey hey! Alright! Yeah, oh yeah. Well uh, the pants. They uh, they fit uh, well and so I uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them!





LOMEZ: It's getting late. Maybe we better get going.



KRAMER: What? You're gonna go now? Hey, whoa! Come on. I don't...





GEORGE: Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the, with the Van Buren Boys.

KRAMER: Hey now, they're tough cookies.

GEORGE: Yeah, and I, I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?

KRAMER: Uh... ah...



KRAMER: Oh nothing. Nothing. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying.



GEORGE: Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!

KRAMER: Yeah, well uh, you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but uh, the Van Buren Boys. They never hassle their own kind.

GEORGE: You mean, like a former member?






ELAINE: These Kramer stories are unusable! I mean, some of them aren't even stories! Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!

JERRY: Is my toaster oven on there?

ELAINE: How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?

JERRY: Well, just shape them, change them. You're a writer.

ELAINE: Yes! I'm a writer.

JERRY: Make them interesting.

ELAINE: Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!



JERRY: Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.

ELAINE: What? Weren't they just here?

JERRY: Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.

ELAINE: Maybe we could all have dinner later?

JERRY: I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.



KRAMER: Oh hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me but as I'm stacking them up they keep falling into my foot bath!



JERRY: Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!

KRAMER: Damn!

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman but they all stink!

ELAINE: How much did you pay for them?

KRAMER: Eight bucks! I think I'm getting ripped off!



KRAMER: Newman!




ELAINE: Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?

PETERMAN: Well, it started out nicely, "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.



PETERMAN: "I set off down a train tunnel."



PETERMAN: But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.

ELAINE: Oh, no no, that's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The, the train is bearing down on you, you dive into a side tunnel and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!

PETERMAN: It just seems so cliched and obvious. It's not interesting writing.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, I know. Um, how about if instead of diving from the train you uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud and ruin your pants?

PETERMAN: The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!





PETERMAN: Peterman here.

KRAMER: Mr. Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!

PETERMAN: You want to know something? I no longer need them!

ELAINE: No no, Mr. Peterman, why don't we keep them as a, as a reference?

PETERMAN: Nonsense! I have Benes's wonderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!

KRAMER: Yippee yi ay!

PETERMAN: There you are Elaine. Go forth and create.



PETERMAN: And by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades, feel free to toss yourself in the mix.






GEORGE: Hey, Van B. Boys.

STEVEN: So, Mr. Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?

GEORGE: Now fellas, fellas... easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.

GANGMEMBERTWO: Is that right? Then why don't you flash us the sign?

GEORGE: Right. The sign.



STEVEN: That's not the sign.

GEORGE: It was when I was banging!

GANGMEMBERTWO: Alright, if you really are one of us let's see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by.

GEORGE: Love to!






ELLEN: And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne.

MORTY: Sorbonne? Oh, hey that's in Paris.



ELLEN: Oh Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change. 


JERRY: So? What do you think?

HELEN: Jerry, she is fantastic.

JERRY: I knew it! I'm not crazy.

HELEN: She's so sweet and she's got some body on her!

MORTY: And smart! Like a computer!

HELEN: And so much personality! But it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?

JERRY: Now I'm not so sure.

HELEN: Well, she's ten times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.

JERRY: Yeah, Amber. I wonder if she's back from Vegas?




GANGMEMBERONE: Alright, no more stalling.

GANGMEMBERTWO: The next one or you're meat!

GEORGE: Alright, alright!



GEORGE: Seinfelds!

MORTY: Hey, George!

GEORGE: Shh! Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.

MORTY: How are your folks?

GEORGE: Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch, you don't want to know. 


GEORGE: Give me your wallet or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!

MORTY: What did you say?

GEORGE: Come on, hurry up old man! I'm an animal!

HELEN: You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.

GEORGE: Please, please, they're gonna hit me!



MORTY: Tell your parents we said Hi!
