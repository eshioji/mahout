

JERRY: The handicap parking spot is the mirage of the parking desert. Do you know that feeling? You see it there in the distance, it's almost, you can't believe your eyes, it's too good to be true. It's a big wide spot, its right by the entrance, somehow everybody missed it! What is the handicap parking situation at the Special Olympics? They must just have to stack like a hundred cars into those two spots. How else are they going to do it?




GEORGE: Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?

ELAINE: We don't walk that fast.

GEORGE: No seriously.

ELAINE: Seriously, we don't.

GEORGE: The better looking they are the faster they go! I mean, I see them out there on the street, they're zooming around, there a blur. It's like they got a motor on their ass.

ELAINE: Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!

JERRY: What's the big hurry?

ELAINE: Hey, how are we getting to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?

JERRY: Oh, the Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.

GEORGE: What, I gotta buy a present now?

ELAINE: Of course you do, it's an engagement party.

GEORGE: Oh it never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.

JERRY: You don't like the Drake?

GEORGE: Hate the Drake.

ELAINE: I love the Drake.

JERRY: How could you not like the Drake?

GEORGE: Who's the Drake?

ELAINE: "Who's the Drake"?

JERRY: The Drake is good!

ELAINE: So listen, what are you gonna get him?

GEORGE: I haven't even met the fiancee! Oh whatever!



JERRY: Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!

ELAINE: So what? That's easy.

JERRY: Easy?



ELAINE: Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?

KRAMER: Uh, no no, not yet.

JERRY: Do you like the Drake?

KRAMER: I love the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!

ELAINE: I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.



KRAMER: That's a nice triangle.

JERRY: It's Isosceles

KRAMER: Oh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.

ELAINE: Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.

JERRY: The chip in!

ELAINE: Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Yeah, the chip in, definitely!

JERRY: You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.

KRAMER: No no, my car's not running.



JERRY: What about your father's car?

GEORGE: No no no, out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighborhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.

JERRY: Are you serious?

GEORGE: You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.

JERRY: How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!

GEORGE: Good thinking!

JERRY: Good to meet you!






ELAINE: So what are we gonna get him?

JERRY: We could get him anything we wanted, we're chipping in.

GEORGE: I like this area. I could live out here.

KRAMER: Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together out here.

JERRY: Yeah, now that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.

GEORGE: Look at this. There's no spaces here. Excuse me, are you getting out?



KRAMER: Why don't you take a handicap spot.

GEORGE: You think?

ELAINE: No no, we'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.

GEORGE: I don't want to walk that far.

ELAINE: What if a handicapped person needs it?

KRAMER: Oh come on, they don't drive!

JERRY: Yes, they do!

KRAMER: Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?

JERRY: Well there's spaces there, they must drive!

KRAMER: Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.

ELAINE: So if you could drive, you're not handicapped?

GEORGE: Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway. We have to get to the party!

KRAMER: I got news for you, handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like everybody else! That's why those spaces are always empty.

GEORGE: He's right! It's the same thing with the feminists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?

ELAINE: What does that mean?

GEORGE: Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.

KRAMER: Go ahead George.

ELAINE: George!

GEORGE: Oh come on, it's five minutes.



KRAMER: Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.

GEORGE: Don't worry.

JERRY: We won't forget.




JERRY: Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV at that price?

ELAINE: What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in thank you's.

GEORGE: What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger.

JERRY: No one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!

ELAINE: Got to love the Drake!



JERRY: Hey, what's going on over here?

ELAINE: Must have been an accident.



JERRY: Hey, what's going on?

PARKINGLOTWOMAN: Some jerk parked in a handicap spot. So this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline and half way up her batteries gave up and she rolled backwards into the wall. Had to take her to St. Elizabeth's.

JERRY: Is she okay?

PARKINGLOTWOMAN: I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!

JERRY: Son's of bitches! Well, good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.



ANGRYMAN: I'm going to get you, you coward!

GEORGE: How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!

ELAINE: Are you happy now?

KRAMER: Who would think these people we're gonna be here?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: What about the party? What about the Drake?

GEORGE: Screw the Drake!

JERRY: I love the Drake!

KRAMER: Let's just take a bus back into the city.

GEORGE: Can't leave the car here!

KRAMER: Why not?

GEORGE: It's my father's car!

ANGRYMAN: Let's smash it!





PARKINGLOTPOLICEMAN: Hey hey hey, leave the car alone!

JERRY: Come on, let's get out of here.






GEORGE: What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?

JERRY: The thing is, even if we go back by the car and there not there, how do we know they're not hiding, waiting for us?

ELAINE: Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?

JERRY: What are we, John Dillinger? I mean, how did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying.

GEORGE: What I don't get is, just because the batteries went dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!

KRAMER: You'd think.

GEORGE: I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?

KRAMER: Most of them don't even have batteries.

GEORGE: Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work. Just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: Well, I'm sorry!

ELAINE: Our big screen TV is probably arriving just about now.

GEORGE: How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!

JERRY: I got it!



JERRY: We give the keys to Elaine.

ELAINE: Me?

JERRY: Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!

ELAINE: Oh they won't?

JERRY: Not if they don't know you.

ELAINE: I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! You know it was all his idea!

KRAMER: No chance in hell!

JERRY: What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we went over by the car and started screaming, "Hey, there he is, there he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then when they all run into the other direction, we jump in the car!

GEORGE: That's good

JERRY: Let's give it a try.

ELAINE: That's good.

JERRY: If that doesn't work, we'll give them Kramer!

KRAMER: What?






GEORGE: Oh my God. No.

JERRY: You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out.




FRANK: Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!





MAHJONGLADYONE: Two bam.

MAHJONGLADYTWO: Three dot.

FRANK: A beautiful Mercury! I special ordered that bench seat!

GEORGE: Dad, this other car cut us off! It had swastikas all over it. They were hurling racial epiphytes at us. I, I could have been killed!

ESTELLE: I told you not to give it to him!

MAHJONGLADYONE: Three crack.

MAHJONGLADYTWO: Four bam.

MAHJONGLADYTHREE: So.

FRANK: You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!

MAHJONGLADYONE: Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!

FRANK: No it isn't!

MAHJONGLADYTWO: So what are you doing now, Georgie?

MAHJONGLADYTHREE: North.

GEORGE: I uh, I'm writing a pilot for NBC.

FRANK: Where the hell is my paper?

MAHJONGLADYONE: You're writing a pilot?

ESTELLE: With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian.

MAHJONGLADYTHREE: So what's it about?

GEORGE: Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be Jerry's butler.

MAHJONGLADYTHREE: This is the same situation!

MAHJONGLADYTWO: Exactly the same.

MAHJONGLADYONE: Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!



ESTELLE: Whenever you're with that Kramer, something happens. He's a real trouble maker!

GEORGE: Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it.

ESTELLE: He's crazy that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice. I don't know what happened to him. Nine bam.

MAHJONGLADYONE: One dot.

MAHJONGLADYTWO: Two crack.

MAHJONGLADYTHREE: Three bam.

ESTELLE: Mahjong.








JERRY: So it was a good party, huh? Oh you're welcome, you're welcome. They loved the TV, loved it!

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her, that's a great idea. Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?

ELAINE: Sure!

JERRY: Sure! Okay. Don't worry, I'm taking my car! Okay, alright see you later, bye. The Drake is great!

ELAINE: Hmm. He's so nice! Man, I'm really happy for them.

JERRY: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them. I mean I'm glad they're happy but frankly, it doesn't do anything for me.





JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.



KRAMER: Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.

JERRY: St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

KRAMER: Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.

ELAINE: You went to see her?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Wow, what happened?

KRAMER: I'm in love.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm, I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.

JERRY: Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.

KRAMER: Yeah.



KRAMER: Ah, I'm glad you're here.

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.

GEORGE: A wheelchair? What for?

KRAMER: Well, you know I went to the hospital today, I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totaled, we gotta get her another one!

GEORGE: Doesn't she have collision?

KRAMER: George, I'm in love with her!

GEORGE: Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.

KRAMER: No! She needs it now!

GEORGE: What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?

KRAMER: Well...

ELAINE: Hey, we told you not to park there!

GEORGE: Can't we just fix the old one?

KRAMER: Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window and see her crawling along Fifth Avenue! Is that what you want?

GEORGE: Alright, alright!! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents, it never ends!!






WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: This is out best model. The Cougar nine thousand. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.

KRAMER: So now uh, what's, what's this got?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's loving it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.

GEORGE: How much?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: Sixty-two hundred.

GEORGE: Do you have something a little more... less expensive?






JERRY: Hey!

ELAINE: Hi Drake!

JERRY: Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!

ELAINE: Oh my God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?

THEDRAKE: Oh yeah, yeah, it's fantastic.



JERRY: I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every super bowl here, every big fight.

ELAINE: Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?

JERRY: So where're we eating?

THEDRAKE: Well, actually... Jerry...

ELAINE: I'm really hungry!

THEDRAKE: We just broke up.



JERRY: When did this happen?

THEDRAKE: About twenty minutes ago.



THEDRAKE: Hey, I am really sorry about this guys, whew!

JERRY: Hell of a picture on this thing.

ELAINE: Oh, crystal clear!

JERRY: They know how to make them.





ELAINE: Drake? Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?

THEDRAKE: Galliano�s... that's pretty good.

JERRY: Well... we should uh...

ELAINE: Get moving.

JERRY: Yeah uh, hey Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.

ELAINE: Yeah, take it easy. Bye bye Alison!



ELAINE: Oh, the remote! Okay. I'm just gonna put it on top of the television. 





WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: Alright, this one is about eight years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen to feed her cat.

KRAMER: But this'll get you around?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: Ah sure, it just doesn't have any of the frills of the Cougar.

GEORGE: Like what?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: For example, your tremor damping.

KRAMER: Now what's that?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.

KRAMER: Well, is it alright if I try it?

WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: Hop in!



KRAMER: Oh yeah!



WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: I tell you...



WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.

GEORGE: How much?



WHEELCHAIRSALESMAN: How about two hundred and forty dollars?

GEORGE: We'll take it.

KRAMER: We'll take it.




ELAINE: Drake gave her the TV?

JERRY: He gave her all the gifts, he felt guilty.

ELAINE: Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's our TV!

JERRY: I know it is!

ELAINE: Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!

JERRY: Hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.

ELAINE: They don't know anybody in Chicago.

JERRY: Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.



GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.

GEORGE: The Drake broke up?! That's fantastic! Now we get the TV back, help defray some of the cost of the wheelchair.

JERRY: I don't know about defraying.

GEORGE: Why?

JERRY: We're not getting that TV.

GEORGE: What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.

ELAINE: The Drakette took it.

GEORGE: She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.

ELAINE: Well, she has it!

GEORGE: I told you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake! Maybe we should call her.

ELAINE: Well, who's gonna call?

JERRY: You are.

ELAINE: What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?

JERRY: Because that's your thing!

ELAINE: What? Calling people I hardly know and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?

JERRY: Yeah, that's your thing.

ELAINE: Alright, give me the phone... it's my "thing"...



JERRY: You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.

GEORGE: Really?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: I could see that.

ALLISONDRAKE: Hello?

ELAINE: Allison! Hi, this is Elaine.

ALLISONDRAKE: I gave all the gifts to charity.

ELAINE: Oh, okay. Well thanks a lot. Sorry again about you and the Drake.

ALLISONDRAKE: I hate the Drake.

ELAINE: Everybody does. Bye bye.



ELAINE: She gave it to charity.

JERRY: Charity?!? That's appalling.

GEORGE: How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!



KRAMER: Hey. Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!

GEORGE: You mean a blessing in disguise?

KRAMER: Yeah.






VOLUNTEERLADY: And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!



VOLUNTEERLADY: Due to his tireless effort, he has personally raised over twenty-two thousand dollars. That's a lot of wheelchairs!



VOLUNTEERLADY: On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!

FRANK: Oh, well thank you very much.



POLICEDETECTIVE: Mr. Costanza?

FRANK: Yes?

POLICEDETECTIVE: You're under arrest.

FRANK: Under arrest? What for?

POLICEDETECTIVE: Reckless endangerment of public safety, violation of traffic code three forty-two A.

FRANK: What's that?

POLICEDETECTIVE: Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go.



FRANK: George! George!






JERRY: Your father got arrested? For what?

GEORGE: Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back he chased after me with a baseball bat.

JERRY: Holy!

GEORGE: Ah, between the car getting totaled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back.

JERRY: So what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: I agreed to become his butler.

JERRY: What?



JERRY: What's the matter?

KRAMER: It's over!

JERRY: What's over?

KRAMER: Me and Lola.

GEORGE: The woman we bought the wheelchair for?

KRAMER: Yeah, she dumped me!

JERRY: She dumped you?

KRAMER: She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster doofus. Am I a hipster doofus?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face. Huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?



GEORGE: You're very attractive.

KRAMER: Yeah. She says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!

JERRY: Drop dead?

GEORGE: Boy, even I never heard that one.

JERRY: She's pretty rough!

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: Well, we just blew two hundred and forty bucks on a wheelchair.

JERRY: Two hundred forty bucks?

GEORGE: Well, it was slightly used.

JERRY: Used?




LOLA: Ah!!! Ah!!!








FRANK: I don't think you did such a good job on these.



GEORGE: What!?

FRANK: You're supposed to see your face there! Do you see your face in there!?





FRANK: Yeah? Oh really? Oh, how about that? Went right down a hill, huh? Okay! Alright! Bye!



FRANK: George, forget about the shoes I Want you to do something for me? 


FRANK: This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.

GEORGE: Sons of bitches!

FRANK: I want you to pick up this big screen TV.

GEORGE: Big screen TV?

FRANK: And deliver it to her. You think you can handle that?






ALLISONDRAKE: Yes?

GEORGE: Uh hi, we're from the United Volunteers. We've uh, come to pick up the TV.

ALLISONDRAKE: Oh great, it's right over there.

KRAMER: Oh, it's a big one!




GEORGE: Who's got the receipt?

ELAINE: I do.

GEORGE: Will they give us cash?

JERRY: That's their policy.

GEORGE: I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here.

KRAMER: Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?

GEORGE: What if there is a fire?

KRAMER: What are the chances of that?
