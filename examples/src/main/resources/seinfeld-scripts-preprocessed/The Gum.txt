



JERRY: I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions.



JERRY: It's not a liquid, it's not a solid, it's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think, "What is the big deal?" But as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say.



JERRY: "Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure." "They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah right. Yeah, I buy that, teach."






GEORGE: You think she's happy?

JERRY: Who?

GEORGE: The cashier.

JERRY: Ruthie Cohen?

GEORGE: You know her name?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: I don't think I've ever spoken to her.

JERRY: Maybe that's why she's happy.



KRAMER: Good morning, gentlemen.

JERRY: What is this?

KRAMER: Yeah well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.

JERRY: That stinky old movie house?

KRAMER: Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.

GEORGE: With Spartacus?



KRAMER: Well, it's a rare archival print.



KRAMER: Twelve extra minutes, full wide screen Cinemascope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Haarwood.

JERRY: Geoffrey who?

KRAMER: Haarwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.

GEORGE: Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?

KRAMER: Well, why go to a fine restaurant when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.

GEORGE: Lloyd Braun? What do you have to meet him for?

KRAMER: Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office to uh, get the theatre landmark status.

JERRY: I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.

KRAMER: Well he did. You know after that he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.

JERRY: Oh, then I'm not worried.



KRAMER: But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh?



GEORGE: Breakdown, huh?

LLOYD: Hey Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy.



LLOYD: How you doing?

KRAMER: Sit down.

LLOYD: Hi Jerry.

JERRY: Lloyd.

LLOYD: George.



GEORGE: Hello Lloyd. How you doing?

KRAMER: Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.



LLOYD: Gum?

JERRY: That's an interesting package.

LLOYD: Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.

KRAMER: Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is.



LLOYD: George?

GEORGE: I don't chew gum.

JERRY: Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?

LLOYD: Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.

JERRY: Nah, don't bother.

LLOYD: No, it's no problem.

JERRY: I don't want it.

KRAMER: Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.






GEORGE: You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.



ELAINE: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lemony.



ELAINE: What kind is that?

JERRY: Its Chinese gum Lloyd Braun gave me.

ELAINE: Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?

GEORGE: After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.

ELAINE: You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. You don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?

JERRY: You know, I remember when we parted company I was babbling incoherently for months.

ELAINE: Yeah? Well, I got news for you.

GEORGE: The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was, "Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?"

JERRY: And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.



GEORGE: Right, gotta get going.

JERRY: Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?

GEORGE: Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.

JERRY: I thought your parents were out of town?

GEORGE: Why do you think I'm going now?






POP: Georgie!

GEORGE: Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

POP: Back in the old neighborhood, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.

POP: Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?

GEORGE: Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.

POP: The actor, right?

GEORGE: Something like that.

POP: Mind if I look under the hood?

GEORGE: Oh, no no no no. Go ahead Pop, you always knew your cars.



POP: Oh Deena! Deena, Deena, look who's here.



DEENA: George Costanza, is that you?

GEORGE: Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug.



GEORGE: Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.

DEENA: Boy, those were some crazy times.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?






KRAMER: The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.

ELAINE: Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?

KRAMER: Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.

JERRY: Oh, can Lloyd really do that?

KRAMER: Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. And you should say hello to him, Elaine.

ELAINE: What? Lloyd is here?



ELAINE: What? No no, I'd rather...

LLOYD: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Lloyd, yes. Hello.

LLOYD: Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats so we can all sit together.

ELAINE: Oh well... I uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, um, because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... um, we'll see you afterwards.



LLOYD: That was odd. Am I crazy or does Jerry not wear glasses?

KRAMER: You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot them, that's all.



KRAMER: Not crazy.







JERRY: We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?

ELAINE: I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.



JERRY: Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.






DEENA: Poor Lloyd.

GEORGE: I know. Completely bonkers!

DEENA: Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.

GEORGE: Pop? What happened to Pop?

DEENA: I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.



POP: Oh I tell you, they don't build them like this any more.



GEORGE: He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?

DEENA: Uh, it was too much for him.



GEORGE: Um, I, I gotta go.

DEENA: What?

GEORGE: I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. That's enough, Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.











GEORGE: Pop! Pop!!






LLOYD: It's a great movie, huh?

KRAMER: Yeah.

LLOYD: Sorry you forgot those glasses.

JERRY: I don't know what I was thinking.

LLOYD: How'd you like that gum?

JERRY: Eh.

KRAMER: Ah, he loved it.



ELAINE: Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies room.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.



ELAINE: Oh. Oh God.

LLOYD: You alright?



ELAINE: Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.








ELAINE: Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?



STREETCOP: Lady, you sold me.



STREETCOP: Hey, you with the hose.








KRAMER: Yeah, put these glasses on.

JERRY: Well, what's this for?

KRAMER: Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.

JERRY: So what?

KRAMER: Well, he thinks you wear those.



KRAMER: They're from the lost and found at the Alex.

JERRY: Aw, come on Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.

KRAMER: Oh, okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Oh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.






GEORGE: Excuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, but you only gave me change for a ten.

RUTHIE: I don't think so.

GEORGE: Oh, I think so and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it. Well, that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?

RUTHIE: Not unless you buy something.

GEORGE: Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.



LLOYD: Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?

GEORGE: I don't.



RUTHIE: Take a look.



GEORGE: I know I gave it to you.

LLOYD: George, would you mind? I'm kind of in a hurry.



GEORGE: [Fine. Fine. Excuse me. Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!






KRAMER: Hey Jerry, look who's here.



JERRY: Ah, Lloyd.

LLOYD: Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.



JERRY: Oh, the gum.

KRAMER: Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

JERRY: Uh, alright.



KRAMER: Oh boy.



KRAMER: Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies sitting around chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.



JERRY: Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.



LLOYD: Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.

JERRY: That's not necessary.

KRAMER: Hey Jerry, you know Lloyd wants to do you a favor.

JERRY: I know that Kramer.

LLOYD: Well, if you don't want to...

KRAMER: No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?

JERRY: Yes I do, Kramer.

LLOYD: So.

KRAMER: Yeah?

LLOYD: How about that Elaine today, huh?

KRAMER: Oh baby, what was that all about, huh?

LLOYD: She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.

JERRY: I didn't see anything.

KRAMER: Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Whoa, ba boom, ba boom ba ba ba boom ba.








DEENA: You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.



GEORGE: Well, you know. It's understandable.



DEENA: I'm glad you feel that way because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.

GEORGE: Warning signs?

DEENA: Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

GEORGE: What? What, what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.

DEENA: Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.

GEORGE: All my friends do that.

DEENA: George, I'm only trying to help.



DEENA: I'm, I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?

GEORGE: You see that woman on the horse?





GEORGE: She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've gotten it back but Lloyd Braun interfered!

DEENA: So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

GEORGE: Hey! Hey you!



GEORGE: Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!








JERRY: So you say she was on a horse?

GEORGE: I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.

JERRY: Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.



ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.

ELAINE: Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I must of left it at the theatre.

JERRY: Maybe it's in the lost and found.

ELAINE: Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.

JERRY: You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.






KRAMER: Mr. Haarwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.

HAARWOOD: Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.

KRAMER: Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?



HAARWOOD: They're half glasses.



KRAMER: Brown?

HAARWOOD: Mmm, yes, yes.



KRAMER: Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax and bring out the luster of this vintage countertop.

HAARWOOD: Certainly.



HAARWOOD: Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.






GEORGE: Alright alright.



GEORGE: Hang on, it's warming up!



GEORGE: Oh you mother...



GEORGE: Hey! What is your problem?



GEORGE: Oh hello, it's you! Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter and I'm not budging till you admit you stole my twenty dollars. You're not so tough when you're not on your horse are you Ruthie?

RUTHIE: Your car's on fire.



GEORGE: Ah! Fire!

RUTHIE: Merry Christmas!



GEORGE: Fire!!



GEORGE: Your hose! Where's your hose?!

FLORIST: Cop made me disconnect it.








KRAMER: Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?

GEORGE: The Jon Voight car is no more.

KRAMER: Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.

GEORGE: No kidding?

KRAMER: No kidding.

GEORGE: Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

KRAMER: Yeah, Merry Christmas.



GEORGE: Whatever.






JERRY: Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?

KRAMER: What, he's not here yet?

JERRY: Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!

KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.



JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.



KRAMER: Here, try this pair.



JERRY: Aw, these are really strong glasses.



LLOYD: Hey gum buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?

JERRY: Yeah yeah.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.

LLOYD: Anybody see Elaine today?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out the lost and found.

LLOYD: Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.



JERRY: Absolutely. Let's just stick around.

LLOYD: Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Let me just grab a hotdog here.

KRAMER: Uh, yeah.



LLOYD: I'd like a hotdog, please.



THEATREATTENDANT: Are you out of your mind?



KRAMER: What, what's the problem here?

THEATREATTENDANT: This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.

KRAMER: No no no no no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.

LLOYD: Kramer, maybe...

KRAMER: No no no no. I'll show you.



KRAMER: One hotdog please.

THEATREATTENDANT: Okay.

KRAMER: Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?



KRAMER: Yeah, here we go, yeah.



KRAMER: Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat.





KRAMER: Um, interesting texture. It's chewy.



KRAMER: I gotta get some air.













ELAINE: Excuse me? Excuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?

FLORIST: How would you happen to know that?

ELAINE: Well, um, I...

FLORIST: You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?

ELAINE: Uh, I...



VOICEONSTREET: Hey, Joe!



ELAINE: No wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!








ELAINE: Hey. Hey everybody.

LLOYD: Whoa, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. Come on Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.



JERRY: Lloyd?



JERRY: Lloyd?



ELAINE: What is Lloyd's problem?

KRAMER: Look honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet  t-shirt.

ELAINE: Uh, I got sprayed with a hose.

KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.








DEENA: So, you want my father to pay for this?

GEORGE: You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.

DEENA: And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.

GEORGE: No, not Lloyd Braun, but the cashier.

DEENA: What cashier?

GEORGE: You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.

DEENA: To park her horse?

GEORGE: No, she wasn't on the horse.

DEENA: So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?

GEORGE: That's right.



GEORGE: And him!

DEENA: The man with the flowers?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...



GEORGE: I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.

DEENA: Who?

GEORGE: Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. Jerry.



GEORGE: Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!



GEORGE: Jerry, where are you going? It's... what...

DEENA: That was your best friend?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.

DEENA: That man was wearing glasses.

GEORGE: I know. Don't you see? He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!






LLOYD: I'll run in and get the gum.

JERRY: Alright.

LLOYD: Got any money?



JERRY: Here.



LLOYD: I'll be back.






GEORGE: Look Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.

DEENA: I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.

GEORGE: Believe me, I am not crazy.

DEENA: Well, I guess it's possible.






LLOYD: Here you go.

JERRY: Got all this?

LLOYD: Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.

JERRY: I gave you a hundred dollars?!

LLOYD: You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lot of gum?

JERRY: It's a lot of gum!







KRAMER: Mr. Haarwood. Found your glasses.

HAARWOOD: Oh splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.

KRAMER: Ah, the I P M P C W.

HAARWOOD: Well uh, we prefer to call it the Institute.



KRAMER: Is that from Henry the Eighth?

HAARWOOD: Yes, yes it is.

KRAMER: Well, you know we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?

HAARWOOD: Well I, I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey like physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume would have to be a short, stocky man of somewhat generous proportions.

KRAMER: You don't say.






KRAMER: You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.

GEORGE: Yeah yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.

KRAMER: Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.

GEORGE: Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me get a pack of gum here.



GEORGE: Can I get a pack of gum, please?

GUMSALESMAN: I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president.

GEORGE: What? Huh, so I had it all along. How do you like that? I guess I owe that cashier an apology.



DEENA: Oh my God!

GEORGE: No no. Deena, it's not what you think.



GEORGE: This, this isn't mine.



GEORGE: I got it from the Institute. The Institute.



GEORGE: Deena!






KRAMER: Ah, Mr. Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.

HAARWOOD: Well thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?

KRAMER: Oh, he ran away.



LLOYD: Hey Kramer.

KRAMER: I need to talk to you.

[Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby where they go into a quiet conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr. Haarwood and in particular at the button he's wearing on his cravat.

ELAINE: You know that button looks very familiar.

HAARWOOD: Yes, it, it, its antique ivory.

ELAINE: I, I think that's my button.



ELAINE: You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?

HAARWOOD: Yes, it was in the lost and found.

ELAINE: Shall I undo it?

HAARWOOD: Oh yes, of course you can.

ELAINE: Oh, thank you.



HAARWOOD: I'm a little ticklish.

ELAINE: Oh. Tickle tickle.



LLOYD: We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.

KRAMER: Oh, tell me about it.
