

JERRY: What's this little scam the airlines have going now with these special clubs? Hundred fifty dollars a year to sit in a room, eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda, and read magazines. Excuse me, but isn't this the flight? I already got four hours of this coming to me. What am I paying for? How about an "I got all my luggage club?" Can I get into that club? Where is that club? I would like to join that club. Airlines love to divide us into classes. You know like when you're sitting in coach, the stewardess always closes that stupid curtain. Always gives you that look, like maybe if you would work a little harder.




JERRY: What time does your flight get in? Six? Alright, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the Diplomat's Club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight.



ELAINE: Is that the supermodel?

JERRY: Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I have six hours.

ELAINE: I thought you had a show in Ithaca.

JERRY: I do, but its three o'clock, I'm flying right back and then I'm going to meet Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.

ELAINE: Well, guess what I'm doing? I'm going to Mr. Pitt's and I am telling him that I am quitting.

JERRY: So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.

ELAINE: I've had enough. I am marching in.

JERRY: You're marching in?

ELAINE: I'm marching.



GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, Elaine's quitting.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: I'm marching in.

GEORGE: I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.

JERRY: How about the march out?

GEORGE: Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: Oh boy, okay that's it. Wish me luck.

GEORGE: Yeah.



JERRY: Get a march going! March it!



GEORGE: Jerry, I uh, need to borrow your camera.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: They're reorganizing the whole staff and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.

JERRY: Isn't putting his picture on your desk a little transparent?

GEORGE: It better be.




ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.

MRPITT: One second Elaine.



ELAINE: Mr. Pitt...

MRPITT: Elaine, do you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.

ELAINE: What?

MRPITT: Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure that you're taken care of after I'm gone.



ELAINE: Oh, oh Mr. Pitt.



MRPITT: You know I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?

ELAINE: Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine.

MRPITT: Yes yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.

ELAINE: We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.








GEORGE: Look at that, I only have one picture left. Ah, you know what, how about a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?

MRMORGAN: Why?

GEORGE: Why? Because we're a team! Come on! Would you take this for us, dear?



GEORGE: Thank you very much. Here we go.



GEORGE: Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.

MRMORGAN: I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?



GEORGE: What? No no, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance. Don't you think he looks like Sugar Ray?



GEORGE: Come on, somebody back me up.



GEORGE: Come on. Little, little help.






JERRY: He looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.

GEORGE: A little? Come on.

JERRY: Well, you still shouldn't have said it.

GEORGE: Do you really think that Mr. Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?

JERRY: Maybe.

GEORGE: Bit that is so unfair. I would have marched down Selma if it was in Long Island.

JERRY: So you would have marched down great then?

GEORGE: Absolutely. Who wouldn't? I still might. I always hated those girls, I would never date one.



KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey

JERRY: There you are.

KRAMER: You ready?

GEORGE: For what?

JERRY: He's taking me to the airport. Oh, we've got a few minutes.



KRAMER: What, you got no luggage?

JERRY: This is it.



JERRY: I'm only gone for the day. I just got to stop by the drug store and pick up a toothbrush.

KRAMER: Okay.

GEORGE: Hey Kramer, what does that look like?





KRAMER: Hmm. I don't know.

GEORGE: Come on, come on. Not salt but...

KRAMER: What, Pepper Johnson?

GEORGE: No. Sugar Ray Leonard.

KRAMER: Oh, no way.

GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you what. I'll bet you the next three people I ask, two of them will say that it looks like Sugar Ray.

KRAMER: How much? A hundred dollars? Two hundred dollars. A thousand!

JERRY: Hey, wait a second, what are you doing? You're not betting. You know he's not supposed to bet.

KRAMER: Come on Jerry, it's a lot.

JERRY: Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three years now. Don't start again.

KRAMER: But it's a lot!

JERRY: No!



JERRY: So what are you going to do about Morgan?

GEORGE: You know what would be great? If he could just see me with some of my black friends.

JERRY: Yeah, except you don't really have any black friends. Outside of us, you don't have any white friends either.






JOETEMPLE: Yes?

GEORGE: Hello Joe?

JOETEMPLE: Who is this?

GEORGE: It's me, George Costanza.

JOETEMPLE: Who?

GEORGE: You remember I, I was here a while back? We watched Breakfast at Tiffany's together?

JOETEMPLE: What do you want?

GEORGE: Well, I rented another video, and there's some popcorn. I thought we could do it again.



GEORGE: Remy! Hi.
 
REMY: You! What are you doing here?

GEORGE: I got another Audry Hepburn movie.

JOETEMPLE: Remy, is that you?

REMY: Daddy, that man's here again.

JOETEMPLE: Remy, I want you up here instantly.



GEORGE: You know, I was just thinking, the last time we were together you...








JERRY: Ah, that's great. You know what, just leave it alone. Just pull the car up front, I'll meet you out there.

KRAMER: Are you sure?

JERRY: Yeah yeah, I'll take care of it. Just throw that down.





MRPITT: Excuse me, I take heart medication. What would you recommend for a runny nose?

JERRY: Take an antihistimine, there over there.



MRPITT: It is alright to take them?

JERRY: Oh yeah, they're great.

MRPITT: What about appetite suppressants?

JERRY: Uh, I just saw them. 



JERRY: Oh, here you go.



MRPITT: Thank you.

JERRY: Have a good day sir.






KRAMER: This is a swanky Diplomat's Club.

JERRY: I don't see Katie anywhere. 

KRAMER: Is she a fellow club member?

JERRY: No, she's this woman that supposed to get me on these college tours. She thinks I'm some  kind of big celebrity that has to be pampered and explained every little thing.

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm going to get some snacks. Before my flight.



KATIE: Jerry.

JERRY: Oh, hi Katie.

KATIE: You found the airport alright?

JERRY: Yes, I followed the planes.

KATIE: I see you're having coffee. Just so you know, they also have decaf as well and I talked to the hostess, they'll also be serving coffee on the plane along with a selection of soda pop.

JERRY: Thanks, thanks for telling me.






ELAINE: What's going on?

LENORE: I'm Lenore Walker, Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer. I arrived to discuss his will and found Justin had collapsed on the floor.

ELAINE: Oh my God.

LENORE: Who are you?

MRPITT: This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine I...

DOCTOR: Please, rest Mr. Pitt.

LENORE: You're the assistant. Why weren't you here taking care of him?

ELAINE: Well he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little um... shopping. How did this happen?

DOCTOR: He took a very dangerous combination, prescription heart medicine and these other pills.

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you supposed to talk with the pharmacist.

MRPITT: I spoke to somebody who worked there.

ELAINE: Oh, I am gonna go and call that pharmacy.



LENORE: How well do you know her?






KATIE: Jerry listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the event of a crash.

JERRY: Yes, I know. I've flown before.

KATIE: Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out. The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?

JERRY: No.

KATIE: Because even if you have to go...



KATIE: ...a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.




KRAMER: Hey, how you doing?

EARL: Pretty good.

KRAMER: Name's Kramer.

EARL: Earl Haffler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed?

KRAMER: Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world and they know the minute they're arriving.

EARL: Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.

KRAMER: Bet? Um, not betting.

EARL: Friendly wager.

KRAMER: I haven't made a bet in three years, I...

EARL: Ah come on. Keep things interesting, pass the time.

KRAMER: Okay, how much?

EARL: How about two hundred?

KRAMER: You're on, cowboy!




GEORGE: How you doing?

JOETEMPLE: Okay.

GEORGE: Nice day today.

JOETEMPLE: What?

GEORGE: I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?








EARL: This could be Mexico City.

KRAMER: Come on Seattle, let's go.

EARL: Come on, Mexico City!

KRAMER: Seattle, yeah!



KRAMER: Alright, come on, let's go again.




ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?

MRPITT: No.

ELAINE: You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?

MRPITT: Okay.






KATIE: It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.

JERRY: I don't care.

KATIE: By the way Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.

JERRY: Who?

KATIE: Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.

JERRY: I don't care, why are you telling me this?

KATIE: I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.

JERRY: Why would I freak out? Pilot.





JERRY: Hey, alright. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here. Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway...



JERRY: ...on the way... up here... um... I...







KATIE: It didn't go very well, did it?

JERRY: No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.

KATIE: I knew it.

JERRY: If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.

KATIE: Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.

JERRY: Oh, it doesn't matter now.

KATIE: Don't worry Jerry. I'm on top of this.

JERRY: Yeah, you're on top of it and I'm on the bottom!




EARL: Well Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole thirty-two hundred. Will that be cash or check?

KRAMER: Alright look, one more bet. Double or nothing. Come on.

EARL: Alright, but I wanna see some cash on the table.

KRAMER: Alright, let me call my bank. You stay here.



NEWMAN: Hello?

KRAMER: Yeah, it's uh, me.

NEWMAN: Hey, what's up?

KRAMER: Alright listen. I need some cash.

NEWMAN: What for?

KRAMER: I just need it, that's all.

NEWMAN: Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?

KRAMER: I'm at the airport.

NEWMAN: The airport?

KRAMER: We've been betting on arrivals and departures.



KRAMER: But I'm down thirty-two hundred, so you've gotta get me some cash.

NEWMAN: I don't have that kind of dough.

KRAMER: Sure you do.

NEWMAN: Oh no no, not the bag!

KRAMER: Oh help me man, I'm desperate!

NEWMAN: Alright alright.




PILOT: Sorry for the delay folks, there is a slight complication that we're taking care of and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia.

JERRY: What is the complication?

FLIGHTATTENDANT: Mr. Seinfeld?

JERRY: Yes?

FLIGHTATTENDANT: I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.

JERRY: What?

FLIGHTATTENDANT: Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you.

KATIE: I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.

JERRY: I didn't care.

FLIGHTATTENDANT: Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.

JERRY: He can't just throw me off the plane!

FLIGHTATTENDANT: Yes he can if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.

JERRY: But I'm not a disturbance!

FLIGHTATTENDANT: Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.

JERRY: But someone is waiting for me!

KATIE: Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.

JERRY: I'm freaking out! I am freaking out!





KATIE: There's a flight leaving at eight and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?

JERRY: Which one do you think I want?

KATIE: The eight will get you in a little earlier.

JERRY: Then we'll make it the eight.

KATIE: I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?

JERRY: Hotel?

KATIE: Yeah, it's eight in the morning.

JERRY: No no no, I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.

KATIE: Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?

JERRY: I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?

KATIE: Okay, you're a big celebrity.





GEORGE: Yo.

JERRY: George.

GEORGE: Hey Jerry, how was Ithaca?

JERRY: I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club.

GEORGE: Hey Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?

JERRY: Carl, I think.

GEORGE: Carl... yeah, he was a nice guy.

JERRY: Yeah, he was nice.

GEORGE: What company was it?

JERRY: Defend.

GEORGE: Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit.

JERRY: You need an exterminator?

GEORGE: No, not really.

JERRY: Oh, don't tell me, because he's black?

GEORGE: Gotta go.

JERRY: George, George!




JERRY: Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?

LENORE: Hold on. Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.

ELAINE: Hello?

JERRY: Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.

ELAINE: That's at the airport, right?

JERRY: Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.

ELAINE: Alright, alright. You sound a little freaked out yourself.

JERRY: I am a little freaked out!

ELAINE: Calm down, I'll take care of it.



JERRY: Alright, but you have to go now.

ELAINE: I said I'll take care of it!




NEWMAN: Kramer.

KRAMER: Hey.

NEWMAN: Okay, here it is.

KRAMER: Good. Here's my collateral.

EARL: So it's a mailbag, so what?

NEWMAN: So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?



EARL: David Berkowitz.

NEWMAN: Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.

EARL: Where did you get this?

NEWMAN: I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.

EARL: Any of them talk to you?

NEWMAN: Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!



EARL: Your buddy's a hell of a guy.

KRAMER: Yeah, don't I know it.

EARL: Okay Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like?

KRAMER: Alright, how about Ithaca versus Boston?

EARL: Alright, I'll give you a sporting chance. I'll take Ithaca.

KRAMER: Double or nothing.

EARL: Double or nothing.

NEWMAN: I hope you know what you're doing.






JERRY: Where are we?

KATIE: I'm not sure.

JERRY: Is this even a road?

KATIE: Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.

JERRY: What? Why didn't you wake me up?

KATIE: You told me not to bother you with minor details.

JERRY: No, road is a major detail!

KATIE: Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?



JERRY: Look out!




GEORGE: May I help you?

KARL: I'm the exterminator.

GEORGE: Oh yes of course, come in.

KARL: Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?

GEORGE: Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?

KARL: Do I know you?

GEORGE: Yeah sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.

KARL: Seinfeld... oh yeah, funny white guy, right?

GEORGE: Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hang on. Is Mr. Morgan in?



GEORGE: He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?








JERRY: That's it! No more questions! I don't care!

MRPITT: That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.

LENORE: Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine.






GEORGE: Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor, pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.

KARL: I'm the exterminator.



GEORGE: That's what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.




EARL: Well, that Newman was your good luck charm.

KRAMER: Yeah, he was.

EARL: I should have quitted at double or nothing. Travelers checks acceptable?

KRAMER: Oh I accept. Yeah, it's a pleasure doing business with a gentleman like yourself.



ELAINE: Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, hi Elaine. What are you doing here?

ELAINE: Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?

EARL: What about the plane in Ithaca?

ELAINE: Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?

KRAMER: Boy.

EARL: Your friend caused the delay?

ELAINE: Uh huh.

EARL: You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Haffler.



KRAMER: Come on!

EARL: See you around, Cosmo.

KRAMER: What?




ELAINE: Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? What? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!

MRPITT: You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.

ELAINE: Goodbye?






JERRY: Bridget!

BRIDGETTE: Jerry, what happened?

JERRY: Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.

BRIDGETTE: Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.

JERRY: Really?



JERRY: Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!




GEORGE: I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.

MRMORGAN: Is that right?

KARL: Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.



MRMORGAN: I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time George, you've sunk to a new low.



GEORGE: Check, please.

WAITER: Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.

GEORGE: Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
