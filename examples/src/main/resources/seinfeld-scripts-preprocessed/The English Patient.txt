



JERRY: You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?

ELAINE: Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?

JERRY: He's wailing on that banjo.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I just don't understand the raisinettes.

ELAINE: The sax player?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.

ELAINE: So?

JERRY: Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.

ELAINE: Heï¿½s not gonna eat them. He's buying them for his Pepsi girlfriend.

JERRY: Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.

ELAINE: He's a musician.

JERRY: Musicians. Get a real job.








WAITRESS: What do you want?

GEORGE: Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.



DANIELLE: Neil.



DANIELLE: Neil.



DANIELLE: Oh, I am sorry. I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.

GEORGE: Really?

DANIELLE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Like me?

DANIELLE: Uh huh. Sorry.



GEORGE: Like me? But how?



WAITRESS: Here's your halibut omelet. Surprised?

GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.






KRAMER: Look what I got for you for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing them out. I got a dozen for a buck.



KRAMER: Saved a fortune. Look at that. Hey.

JERRY: Oh, "Number One Dad".

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Oh, and it's in medium. Perfect.



KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey. You ready?

JERRY: Almost.

KRAMER: Okay, look uh, when you're in Florida can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents house?

JERRY: Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.

KRAMER: Aw, come on man. Help a brother out.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Yeah. I owe you one.

JERRY: We're even.



GEORGE: Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to mistakes me for her boyfriend.

JERRY: That's a nice four seconds.

GEORGE: I look just like him. Me. This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?

JERRY: Maybe he has money.

GEORGE: Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same except for one minor yet crucial detail. You never know.

JERRY: Sometimes you do.

GEORGE: Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a... or a cane.

JERRY: Who's she dating? Mr. Peanut?



GEORGE: She could do a lot worse than Mr. Peanut, my friend.








BLAINE: So, what do you wanna see?

ELAINE: What about Sack Lunch?

BLAINE: How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.



ELAINE: Oh, come on Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

BLAINE: It's a family in a brown paper bag.

ELAINE: Don't you wanna know how they got in there?

BLAINE: No.



ELAINE: Aw. Sold out.

BLAINE: Oh, two for The English Patient.



ELAINE: So do you think they got shrunk down or is it just a giant sack?






GEORGE: Uh, hi. Um, remember me? I, I'm the guy who looks like Neil?

DANIELLE: Hi.

GEORGE: Huh hi. Um, is Neil here?

DANIELLE: Oh no, he got held up at work.

GEORGE: Oh, that's too bad. I kind of wanted to meet him seeing as how we look so similar.

DANIELLE: Well, you know you don't look that much like him.

GEORGE: Oh. Of course not.

DANIELLE: No, you're a little taller.



DANIELLE: You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?

GEORGE: Listen, I, I, I don't mean to seem forward...



GEORGE: ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?








ELAINE: Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". God, that movie stunk!

BLAINE: I kind of liked it.

ELAINE: No you didn't.



CAROL: Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?

GAIL: Didn't you love it?

LISA: How could you not love that movie?

ELAINE: How about, it sucked?

CAROL: That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.

ELAINE: Huh, getting the short end of that stick.








MORTY: Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.

JERRY: Stairmaster?

MORTY: What?

JERRY: Nothing.

MORTY: See what I'm wearing?



JERRY: Oh, did you get that out of my bag?

MORTY: No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.

JERRY: You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.



MORTY: Ho, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. Watch this.



MORTY: See that? You couldn't do that.

JERRY: I could, but I choose not to.



SID: Hey Morty. Who's this?

MORTY: This is my son Jerry, from New York. He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.

JERRY: I, I didn't say that.

SID: Hey Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.



IZZY: Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.

JERRY: Actually, I am a comedian.

SID: That's not so funny.

IZZY: Think you're better than me, huh?

MORTY: Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.

JERRY: Eighteen fifties?

IZZY: Yeah, that's it. It's go time. Let's see you lift that.

JERRY: Mr. Mandelbaum, I...

IZZY: Come on, come on. Pump it!

JERRY: Alright.

IZZY: Yeah, wrong attitude. You're not bringing that trash into my house.



JERRY: There. Alright?

IZZY: Step aside, string bean.



IZZY: I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.



IZZY: Ah! My back. Ugh.



IZZY: Ah.



SID: Somebody, call an ambulance.

MORTY: There's already an ambulance here for Mrs. Glickman. There's room for one more.






ELAINE: Okay, one for Sack Lunch. It's good, right? Yeah, good.



ELAINE: Hey, what're you guys doing here?

LISA: We just saw The English Patient again.

GAIL: It's even better the second time.

ELAINE: They make it longer?



BLAINE: Got my umbrella.

ELAINE: Blaine!?

BLAINE: Elaine.

ELAINE: I thought you were busy tonight.

BLAINE: Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.

ELAINE: It's just a stupid movie.

BLAINE: That's what I'm talking about.

CAROL: Come on, Blaine. Let's go.

BLAINE: Enjoy Sack Lunch!



ELAINE: I will!






HELEN: How could you do that to Mr. Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.

JERRY: He egged me on.

HELEN: You should be more mature.

JERRY: He's eighty!

MORTY: Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologize. Now, goodnight.



HELEN: You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.

MORTY: This shirt will never leave my body.



HELEN: Goodnight.

JERRY: Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.



GUILLERMO: Jerry Seinfeld please.

JERRY: Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. Come on in. You got the cigars?



GUILLERMO: What cigars?

JERRY: Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.

GUILLERMO: We are the Cubans.








KRAMER: Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.



JERRY: They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!

KRAMER: I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?

JERRY: Cigars!

KRAMER: Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.

JERRY: You're making your own cigars now?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.



JERRY: Hold on a second. Hi dad.



MORTY: Who are they?

JERRY: They're Cuban cigar rollers.

MORTY: Don't tell your mother.



JERRY: What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?

KRAMER: Hot and spicy.

JERRY: You're not wearing a shirt are you?

KRAMER: Yes I am.

JERRY: What color is it?



KRAMER: Damn!








GEORGE: You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You, you didn't have to take me out to dinner.

DANIELLE: I wanted to give it to you in person.



DANIELLE: You know, I don't have to be up in the morning and I know a great breakfast place right around the corner.



GEORGE: Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?

DANIELLE: Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.

GEORGE: I really should get going. You know, I, I wanna be home in case Neil calls.

DANIELLE: Well, goodnight.



GEORGE: I'll see you.








WAITRESS: Rough night?

ELAINE: Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.

WAITRESS: Really? I thought it was pretty good.

ELAINE: Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Give me something I can use!

WAITRESS: Well, I liked it.



ELAINE: Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!






JERRY: This is quite a condo.

MORTY: The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.

JERRY: The crepe place?

MORTY: Yeah. This is all big crepe money.

JERRY: There's crepe money?



IZZY: What are you doing here?

JERRY: Aw, Mr. Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.



IZZY: What the hell is that?

JERRY: What?

IZZY: That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?

MORTY: This was a gift from my son.



IZZY: Oh, I see how it works now. He knocks me out of commission so you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. Well, I'll show you who's number one.



JERRY: Mr. Mandelbaum, please.

IZZY: It's go time.



IZZY: Ah! My back. I can't move.



MORTY: Call an ambulance.

JERRY: I think I saw one a couple of doors down.








JERRY: So she wanted you to come up but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!



GEORGE: Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.

JERRY: George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out Neiled him.

GEORGE: So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?

JERRY: I don't know, but you better keep it up.

GEORGE: I'm gonna go meet Danielle. There's a new Neil in town!



JERRY: I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. Hello?



MORTY: Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?

JERRY: I will, I just walked in the door.

HELEN: You have to go see him.

JERRY: Ma.

MORTY: Helen, will you stop bothering him.

HELEN: Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.

MORTY: Number One, signing off.



KRAMER: Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. What's going on!?

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: So Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.

JERRY: What's the difference?

KRAMER: Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.

JERRY: We're talking about people, right?

KRAMER: Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.

JERRY: I thought they smelled pretty nice.

KRAMER: Jerry, your palate's unrefined.

JERRY: Is not.

KRAMER: Is too.

JERRY: Is not.

KRAMER: Is too.

JERRY: I'm not having this conversation.

KRAMER: Are too.

JERRY: Am not.

KRAMER: Are too.

JERRY: Am not.

KRAMER: Are too.






PETERMAN: Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.


DUGAN: Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.



PETERMAN: Elaine, what'd you think?

ELAINE: Well uh, actually I haven't seen it. So I couldn't tell you whether I liked it or whether it really sucked.

PETERMAN: You haven't seen it?

ELAINE: No.

PETERMAN: That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.








JERRY: Again, Mr. Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to uh, try and find my number.



IZZY: Uh, oh wait.



IZZY: How about that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.

JERRY: That's very nice.

IZZY: The best in the world. Which means I'm better than just number one.

JERRY: Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.



IZZY: Hi, son.

IZZYJR: Hi, daddy.

JERRY: This is your son?

IZZY: I got married in high school.

IZZYJR: Hey, who are you?

IZZY: This is Seinfeld's kid.

IZZYJR: Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.

JERRY: You got any kids?

IZZYJR: Oh, you think you're better than me? Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.

JERRY: Look, no one is lifting anything.

IZZY: The television.

JERRY: Oh no.



IZZYJR: This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.



IZZYJR: Oh! My back!

IZZY: Call an ambulance.

JERRY: We're already in a hospital.






EARL: Aright partner. Let's get down to business.

KRAMER: Okay, well uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.



KRAMER: They're right out here.



KRAMER: Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.



EARL: You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?

KRAMER: Oh, now come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.

EARL: We're talking about people, right?

KRAMER: I think so.

EARL: I thought he quit smoking cigars.

KRAMER: Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother...



KRAMER: ...Dennis.

EARL: Dennis Castro?

KRAMER: Uh, Dwayne.

EARL: Get the hell out of my office.

KRAMER: What!?






DANIELLE: You know, Neil called me today.

GEORGE: Really?

DANIELLE: Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.

GEORGE: Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.

DANIELLE: He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.

GEORGE: Coffee? I can beat that. Move in with me.

DANIELLE: What?

GEORGE: Beats the hell out of coffee.








PETERMAN: And I thought I knew what love was.



ELAINE: Yeah.






JERRY: You asked her to move in with you?

GEORGE: I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

JERRY: What if it's Neil Armstrong?



GEORGE: Then I'm going to Mars!

JERRY: What if it's Neil Diamond?

GEORGE: Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!

JERRY: Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.

GEORGE: What, to see the old guy?

JERRY: No, I got into a thing with the son and now he's laid up too.

GEORGE: How old is the son?

JERRY: I think he's the same age as the father.

GEORGE: What is with this family?

JERRY: I don't know. It's like if one of them dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.



KRAMER: Hey, Jerry.



JERRY: You're cold?

KRAMER: No.



JERRY: Something wrong with your chest?



KRAMER: There.

JERRY: Where?

KRAMER: No no, don't look. Don't look.



KRAMER: Over there. The Dominicans.

JERRY: Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?

KRAMER: Well, it didn't quite work out and now I've got nothing for them to do.

GEORGE: So?

KRAMER: So, I taught them all about Cuba and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.



JERRY: Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.

KRAMER: Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work and the people get restless, who do you think they come after?



KRAMER: El Presidente!








JERRY: I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.

IZZYJR: I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy in Florida.

JERRY: He couldn't handle the weight.

IZZY: Oh, so now you think you're better than me?

IZZYJR: You think you're better than him?!

JERRY: Look, let me just state for the record I think you're both better than me.

IZZY: Okay.



IZZYSR: My boys.

IZZY: My dad.

IZZYJR: My grandpa.

JERRY: Oh, come on!

IZZYSR: What happened to him?

JERRY: He was trying to lift the TV.

IZZYSR: That TV?



JERRY: Oh no. It's go time.



IZZYSR: Oh!






IZZYSR: Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!

IZZY: I still thought you could do it.

IZZYJR: Me too.

IZZY: Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...

JERRY: Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.

IZZY: Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.

JERRY: I didn't ruin your business.

IZZY: Yes you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.

JERRY: Don't you hire people to do that?

IZZY: Each crepe has to be hand rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!

JERRY: So, you just need some guys that could roll them?

IZZY: Yeah.

JERRY: I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.



IZZYSR: Hey, I can't see the TV.



JERRY: Here.



IZZY: You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?






PETERMAN: Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.

ELAINE: Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert and just die already! Die!!



PETERMAN: Elaine. You don't like the movie?

ELAINE: I hate it!!



ELAINE: Oh, go to hell!!

PETERMAN: Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.

ELAINE: Great. I'll wait for you outside.








JERRY: He was gonna fire you?

ELAINE: The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.

JERRY: Tunisia?

ELAINE: That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.

JERRY: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

ELAINE: I have to live in a cave.

JERRY: Oh.



KRAMER: These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.



KRAMER: Just a cigar made out of bisquik huh, Guillermo?





DANIELLE: I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.



DANIELLE: Come on, let's just eat our crepes.











DANIELLE: Neil!



JERRY: Why are the crepes spraying?

KRAMER: The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. Um, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.








GEORGE: Danielle. Where's Neil? Is this him?

DANIELLE: Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.



GEORGE: Whose cane is this?

DANIELLE: It's Neil's.



GEORGE: A cane. I knew it. So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr. Peanut.



GEORGE: Well Danielle, we should get going. I got a key made for you.



DANIELLE: George, I can't move in with you.

GEORGE: What?

DANIELLE: I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.

GEORGE: No no no. You can't leave me. Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!

DANIELLE: Sorry George.



NEIL: George.



NEIL: I win.










ELAINE: No no no no no.



ELAINE: Alright! Aw, this is shaping up.



GUILLERMO: Excuse me, please.

ELAINE: Oh, sure.



ELAINE: Oh.



GUILLERMO: Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan Crepe restaurants...



GUILLERMO: ...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!



GUILLERMO: Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!

ELAINE: Aw, nuts!
