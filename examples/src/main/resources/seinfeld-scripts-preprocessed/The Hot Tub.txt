

JERRY: I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking, "How much did you lose by?" I don't even know! I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything. I was doing push ups, sit ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for twenty years. I flew half way around the world and ah!



JERRY: And that was... it was a photo finish! Silver.



JERRY: Gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.




JERRY: I can't believe you write for this J. Peterman catalog. Get this one. "I packed my rod and reel. Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord, a welcoming smile. Thank God she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice fishing vest."

GEORGE: This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.

ELAINE: Yeah. What do you do all day?

GEORGE: Not that much.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.

GEORGE: Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.

JERRY: How do you pull that off?

GEORGE: I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time people think that you're busy. Think about it.



ELAINE: Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!

JERRY: Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!

GEORGE: I know what I'm doing. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. Alright. Back to work. 





JERRY: So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?

ELAINE: No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.

JERRY: What marathon runner?

ELAINE: You know, this guy Jean Paul, Jean Paul. I met him when I was working at Pendant editing a book on running.

JERRY: Oh wait! Jean Paul, Jean Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics four years ago and missed the marathon?!

ELAINE: Yeah, that's him.

JERRY: He's from uh, Trinidad and Tobago right?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah he's Trinidadian and... Toboggan.



JERRY: How do you oversleep at the Olympics?

ELAINE: Ah, I know, I know!

JERRY: I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have like, six alarm clocks, paying off little kids in the village to come banging on your door.

ELAINE: Yeah well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in three years.

JERRY: Ah, that's a big responsibility on your hands.

ELAINE: What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.

JERRY: You gotta wake him up!

ELAINE: Oh, he'll get up.



ELAINE: Hi Judy.

JUDY: Hi Elaine. How are you?

ELAINE: Fine.



JERRY: I've seen her in your building.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I didn't know she was married.

ELAINE: She's not and the guy just took off.



ELAINE: Don't say anything to anybody.

JERRY: Who am I gonna tell?

ELAINE: I know, it's just something you have to say.






WILHELM: George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem.



WILHELM: I'll let you get back to work, George.








JERRY: He overslept and missed the whole race? Isn't that amazing?

GEORGE: I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM PM mixed up.

JERRY: My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five and it never came back on.



JERRY: Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.

KRAMER: Alarm clocks? I never use them. Don't trust them.

JERRY: What do you do?

KRAMER: I have a uh, mental alarm. I set my head for quarter to seven and...



KRAMER: I get up.

JERRY: Always works?

KRAMER: Oh, it never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.

GEORGE: Uh huh. What's with the bucket?

KRAMER: Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

JERRY: Hot tub?

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it.

GEORGE: You put a hot tub in your living room?

KRAMER: Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high volume aqua sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over one hundred and twenty degrees!

GEORGE: Is that tolerable?

KRAMER: Oh, it's tolerable.

JERRY: Isn't that the same temperature of the coffee that scalded you?

KRAMER: Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that.



GEORGE: He uh, doesn't have any running water?

JERRY: I don't ask those kinds of questions anymore.






ELAINE: Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean Paul.

JERRY: Ah, hi Jean Paul. Nice to meet you.

JEANPAUL: Nice to meet you.

JERRY: Sorry about the Olympics.

JEANPAUL: Me too.

ELAINE: Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't come up with anything for this thing.

JERRY: Ah, catalog writer's block?

ELAINE: Yeah, that's funny.



JERRY: So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

JEANPAUL: Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze but no, no snooze.

JERRY: AM PM?

JEANPAUL: Man, it wasn't the AM PM It was the volume.

JERRY: Ah, the volume.

JEANPAUL: Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.

JERRY: Ah, separate knob.

JEANPAUL: Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?!

JERRY: Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.

JEANPAUL: Oh please man, please!

JERRY: Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.



JERRY: Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?

ELAINE: Jerry.

JERRY: It's a simple question.

ELAINE: I've got an alarm, okay?

JERRY: That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?

JEANPAUL: Flight to Cleveland?

ELAINE: It works.

JERRY: Elaine.

ELAINE: It works!






GEORGE: Captain and... uh...



GEORGE: Tanielle!



GEORGE: Come on.





WILHELM: George, I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.



GEORGE: Well, I've got a lot to do!

WILHELM: George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.



WILHELM: I have this fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There are some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play and I want you to show them a good time.








ELAINE: Hey. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY: You're forty minutes late. What happened?

ELAINE: I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: What?



ELAINE: What is the problem?

JERRY: Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time and you weren't.

ELAINE: Uh huh. Uh huh. And this all means uh... what?

JERRY: Well, it means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!

ELAINE: Oh are you?!

JERRY: Yes I am.

ELAINE: Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!

JERRY: Yeah, I know that!

ELAINE: Yeah, I got enough to think about just trying to come up with some load of crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!

JERRY: I'm not talking about upside down. I'm talking about waking him up!



ELAINE: Hey, Jean Paul.

JERRY: Hey, Jean Paul. How was your soak? Was it a good soak?

JEANPAUL: Ah man, very good soak. The soak of the year!

KRAMER: What's burning?

ELAINE: Oh!



ELAINE: My muffin!



ELAINE: Oh, shoot!



JERRY: What happened?

ELAINE: Oh I don't know. I set this thing for twenty seconds.

KRAMER: This was set for two minutes. See?



ELAINE: Don't say anything! Don't... say... anything!

JEANPAUL: You miss set the timer?

ELAINE: Jean Paul, it's not my microwave, okay? Okay? Alright listen, let's just go. Come on Jean Paul, let's go. Let's go.

JEANPAUL: Okay.

ELAINE: Alright. We'll see you at the race, okay?

JERRY: Yeah, I hope so!

ELAINE: Oh that's cute!



JERRY: Kramer, I'm telling you, Elaine doesn't know what the hell she's doing! I gotta take over this whole operation!

KRAMER: Jerry, look how tense you are. You need to take a soak.

JERRY: I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got going there.

KRAMER: Come on, I'm telling you, it's great. I opened up all the windows, the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot. It's like Sweden, man. Sweden!






KRAMER: Oh yeah. Ah.






CLAYTON: Till this bastard over here says, "Let's call the sons of bitches and go visit them in New York!"



GEORGE: Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.

GARDNER: I like your organization, George. We've been talking to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think is his name.

GEORGE: Oh yes, Mr. Wilhelm, yeah.

GARDNER: He told us that George Costanza was gonna be taking us bastards out on the town.



GARDNER: I said, "That son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!"



ZEKE: Finish your drink?

GEORGE: Oh yeah, almost, almost.

ZEKE: Let's get that bastard bring us another round!



CLAYTON: You a big drinker, George?

GEORGE: Well, maybe not as much as this bastard.



GEORGE: I can hold my own!











JERRY: Jean Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay is uh...

JEANPAUL: What are you saying?

JERRY: I'm saying, "Get the hell out of there!" Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly, you'll have a wake up call, Jean Paul! A wake up call!

JEANPAUL: Wake up call.

JERRY: These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waiting to make that call! 


JEANPAUL: No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.

GEORGE: Hey, you bastards.

JERRY: Hey, how was the meeting?

GEORGE: I really like those sons of bitches.

JERRY: Sons of bitches?

GEORGE: Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh, "Boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, huh?!"



JEANPAUL: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: How many sweaters you got on?

KRAMER: Oh, four. Yeah, could I have a cup of tea? Boiling hot.

GEORGE: What's going on?

KRAMER: I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to fifty-eight degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!

JERRY: Your core temperature?

KRAMER: Here, feel my hand.



KRAMER: Yeah, feel.

JEANPAUL: Phew, this son of a bitch is ice cold.






GEORGE: Hello?

CLAYTON: uh, is that you, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

CLAYTON: Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? Thirty thousand feet above your head, you bastard!



GEORGE: What are they doing letting you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?

CLAYTON: Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!

GEORGE: Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!

ZEKE: When's that bastard coming to Houston?

CLAYTON: Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are coming to Houston!

GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever coming to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.

CLAYTON: Hey, uh, speak up George, I can't hear you!



GEORGE: You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever coming to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!



WILHELM: George! George, get a hold of yourself!

GEORGE: Mr. Wilhelm.

WILHELM: What's the matter with you?!

GEORGE: Well I, I...






ELAINE: It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu.



ELAINE: Oh! This stinks!



ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on! God!








JEANPAUL: Hello.

JUDY: Hello.

JEANPAUL: I'm a friend of Elaine's.

JUDY: Oh, hi.



JEANPAUL: Oh, look at the cute little bastard.



JEANPAUL: You are mama's little bastard, aren't you?





BUILDINGMANAGER: What the hell are you doing harassing my tenants?

JEANPAUL: Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.

BUILDINGMANAGER: Alright, that's it!



BUILDINGMANAGER: Let's go!

JEANPAUL: What? But I got a race tomorrow!






GEORGE: Whoa, it's like a furnace in here!

JERRY: Oh, what the hell is going on?!

KRAMER: Yeah, I turned up the heat.

JERRY: Turn up the heat in your apartment!



KRAMER: I'm freezing! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

GEORGE: Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?

KRAMER: Huh? Oh that must be it.

GEORGE: It's huge!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. Sixteen thousand BTU's.



JERRY: Hello? Yeah, I can be there in ten minutes. You can count on me!



GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I got the call!

GEORGE: Jean Paul?

JERRY: Jean Paul!






JERRY: Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean Paul.

JEANPAUL: Man, I just want to get some sleep.



JERRY: Alright.



JERRY: Let's check out the clock. Notch good... six fifty... volume check.



JERRY: What kind of music you wanna wake up to? Top forty, classical?

JEANPAUL: Man, whatever!

JERRY: How about adult contemporary?

JEANPAUL: Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one!

JERRY: Alright, we're going with adult contempo.



JERRY: Now the fail safe. The wake up guy.



JEANPAUL: Yes yes, the wake up guy.



JERRY: Yeah, this is room four nineteen, I'd like a wake up call for six fifty am tomorrow morning.



JERRY: That's room four nineteen. Six fifty am. Four... one... niner.



JERRY: I know, but it's a very important wake up call and I don't wanna take any chances.



JERRY: Well, I just don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...



JERRY: Yeah I am, but I just...





JERRY: Hmm.

JEANPAUL: What is it?

JERRY: I think I offended the wake up guy.

JEANPAUL: No, no.

JERRY: No no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!

JEANPAUL: Man, he doesn't got it in for you.

JERRY: What if he doesn't call now out of spite?

JEANPAUL: It is his job!



JERRY: Not comfortable.



JEANPAUL: For God's sake!








ELAINE: Jean Paul? Hey Jean Paul? Jean Paul? Jean Paul?! Oh man.



ELAINE: Oh, machine.

JERRY: I'm not here, leave a message.

ELAINE: Jerry, Jerry, Jean Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back.





ELAINE: Judy, hi, listen...

JUDY: You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!

ELAINE: Oh, I didn't tell anyone.

JUDY: Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it.



ELAINE: Jerry!








JERRY: Feel much better here at my home base, Jean Paul. It's a controlled environment.

JEANPAUL: It's a marathon, you know. Twenty-six miles! I need to get some sleep!



JERRY: Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona you'd be polishing that medal right now.



JEANPAUL: Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!

JERRY: That wake up guy was trouble! Alright, I'll be right back.





JERRY: Man that thing is noisy!

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to eighty degrees!

JERRY: Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for six thirty and give me a call.

KRAMER: Yeah, okay, wait.



KRAMER: Done!








JERRY: He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.

JEANPAUL: I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

JERRY: Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

ELAINE: Oh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces... so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless... a bastard child perhaps. My back aches, my heart aches, but my feet.



ELAINE: My feet are resilient!



ELAINE: Thank God I took off my heels and put on my Himalayan walking shoes!



ELAINE: Yes!
















JERRY: Four oh two?



JERRY: Ah! Eight forty-seven!! Jean Paul! Wake up! Wake up!



JERRY: Jean Paul! The electricity went out! Wake up! Wake up! We gotta go! It's eight forty-seven!

JEANPAUL: Eight forty-seven!?





JERRY: Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!

JEANPAUL: Idiot! I trusted you!



JERRY: Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!

KRAMER: Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!

JERRY: What happened to your mental alarm?!

KRAMER: I guess I hit the snooze.








JERRY: Make way! I've got, I've got a runner here! Get out of the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender!



MARATHONGUARD: Hey, hold it!

JEANPAUL: I'm late, man, I'm in the race!

MARATHONGUARD: Go ahead.

JEANPAUL: Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!

JERRY: Alright go, it's a race! Come on!






GEORGE: You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?

MRSTEINBRENNER: Yes George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.

GEORGE: Oh no, Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George. I used to be like you. Rating personnel till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you George. Hot tub.








JERRY: I'm telling you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!

ELAINE: Then how did she find out, Jerry?!

JERRY: Maybe you should check with the rabbi.

KRAMER: You want some hot tea?

ELAINE: Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER: Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!



ELAINE: There's Jean Paul! He's up front! He's leading! Go Jean Paul!

KRAMER: Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on!

JERRY: Come on, let's go Jean Paul!

ELAINE: Go Jean Paul!






MRSTEINBRENNER: How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stick her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. You know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?

GEORGE: Well I, I just recently uh...

MRSTEINBRENNER: I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild going on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one of these things. Just like four shots of wild turkey.  She'll think you're Hop along Cassidy.



MRSTEINBRENNER: A show about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know?
