

JERRY: It's amazing to me that people will move thousands of miles away to another city, they think nothing of it. They get on a plane, boom. They're there, they live there now. Just uh, I'm living over there. You know, pioneers, it took years to cross the country. Now, people will move thousands of miles just for one season. I don't think any pioneers did that, you know. Yeah, it took us a decade to get there and uh, we stayed for the summer. It was nice, we had a pool, the kids loved it and then we left about ten years ago and we just got back. We had a great summer, it took us twenty years and now our lives are over.




GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Murphy Brown, the TV show?

JERRY: Come on, will you?

GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!

JERRY: Something, isn't it?

GEORGE: With Candace Bergen!

JERRY: I know!

GEORGE: I've always liked her. Remember her in "Carnal Knowledge"?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: Did she show her breasts in that?

JERRY: She's not really the naked type.

GEORGE: I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.

JERRY: He did?

GEORGE: Yeah, I turned him down.

JERRY: How come you didn't tell me?

GEORGE: He asked me to keep it a secret.

JERRY: But you can never keep a secret.

GEORGE: I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Jodi Hersch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about twenty-eight seconds.

JERRY: Well, you've come a long way.

GEORGE: I've matured.

JERRY: Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me and they want me to come out and do the show on the twenty-eighth and they're giving me two free tickets to L.A. You wanna go?

GEORGE: A free ticket?

JERRY: Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.

GEORGE: What about accommodations?

JERRY: All taken care of.

GEORGE: Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour?



GEORGE: They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me... 






KRAMER: So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.



STUDIOGUARD: Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?

KRAMER: Uh, did you?

STUDIOGUARD: Come on, let's go.



KRAMER: Well, I was just...

STUDIOGUARD: Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. Come on, let's go.

KRAMER: Alright, we'll talk about this a little later.



KRAMER: Are you an actor?




KRAMER: See you Mike!






KRAMER: Uh yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.



KRAMER: Uh, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.



KRAMER: Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home.



KRAMER: Go ahead, it's all yours.



HELENA: Hello Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?

HELENA: I haven't worked since nineteen thirty-four, how do you think I am?

KRAMER: Well, that's only uh, fifty-eight years.

HELENA: It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?

KRAMER: Yeah right, right, yeah yeah, that was a Shemp, right?

HELENA: No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.

KRAMER: Uh huh, right.

HELENA: But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.

KRAMER: Right.

HELENA: Moe hits Curly with an axe.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

HELENA: The Stooges catch the kidnappers.

KRAMER: Right.

HELENA: But it's too late.

KRAMER: Really?

HELENA: The baby's dead.

KRAMER: Really?

HELENA: The boys are sent to death row and are executed.

KRAMER: Well I don't remember that part.

HELENA: I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.

HELENA: It was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.

KRAMER: Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.

HELENA: Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?

KRAMER: Uh, well uh, you know I can't right now, you know uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?

HELENA: Oh no! No, don't go out there Kramer. They'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me.

KRAMER: Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.

HELENA: I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!




JERRY: What is this?

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?

GEORGE: I happen to dress based on mood.

JERRY: Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.

GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.

JERRY: And what mood is this.

GEORGE: This is Morning Mist.




LTCOLEMAN: What do you figure, twenty? Twenty-one?

LTMARTEL: Close enough.

LTCOLEMAN: Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.

LTMARTEL: No ID?

LTCOLEMAN: No ID.

LTMARTEL: No witnesses?

LTCOLEMAN: Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.

LTMARTEL: She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.

LTCOLEMAN: Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?

LTMARTEL: I don't know, but I don't like it.




JERRY: Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.

GEORGE: Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.

JERRY: Just go.



GEORGE: Huh he, I made it.



AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Empty your pockets please.



AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Walk through again please.



AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?

JERRY: Anklets?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: A lot of men wear anklets.

JERRY: Really?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Yeah.

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: What do you have in your bag, sir?

GEORGE: My bag?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Step over here please.

JERRY: Over here?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: Do you have a knife in the bag?

GEORGE: A knife?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: Open the bag, please.



AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: What's this?

GEORGE: Moisturizer?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: Your wife?

GEORGE: No, I uh... I use it.

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Spread your arms and legs please.



JERRY: Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDTWO: Have a good trip.

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: Alright, go ahead.

JERRY: That's it?

AIRPORTSECURITYGUARDONE: That's it.

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: Come on Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?

JERRY: I must have iron rich blood.

GEORGE: Here we go, L.A.

JERRY: The coast.

GEORGE: La-la land. I got the window seat, right?

JERRY: Who said that?

GEORGE: I called it.

JERRY: Oh no.




JERRY: Seems to me that the closest thing we have to royalty in America are the people that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate these things? They come out of nowhere, "Beep beep, cart people, look out, cart people! Look out!" We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. "Oh! It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people, Timmy, they're the best people in the world." You know, if you're too fat, slow and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel. The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?




KRAMER: Oh, uh yeah, I'm here for the audition.

AUDITIONRECEPTIONIST: Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial?

KRAMER: Uh.



KRAMER: Let's see... well.




























KRAMER: You scream good.

CHELSEA: You too.




CHELSEA: So, can I keep this treatment?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, I got twenty copies.

CHELSEA: Because I can uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money.

KRAMER: Really?

CHELSEA: Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

KRAMER: Mmm hmm.

CHELSEA: What was it like having sex with Adolph Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...

KRAMER: Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.

CHELSEA: Oh, big deal.

KRAMER: He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.



KRAMER: I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.

CHELSEA: Why are you breathing so hard?

KRAMER: Well, I'm just a little nervous. Okay, I gotta relax.



KRAMER: Wish me luck, huh?



KRAMER: Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the uh...

FREDSAVAGE: Oh, thank you.

KRAMER: Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.

FREDSAVAGE: Thanks.

KRAMER: Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sort of nervous, you know uh...

FREDSAVAGE: That's okay. Relax, relax.

KRAMER: Okay, but I got this...



KRAMER: Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming. I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.



FREDSAVAGE: Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.

KRAMER: I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.

FREDSAVAGE: Yeah.

KRAMER: So I'd like to give it to you.

FREDSAVAGE: Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!



KRAMER: Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.






JERRY: Yeah, Kramer. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?

GEORGE: Curly.

JERRY: Wavy.

GEORGE: What'd you ask me for?

JERRY: Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?

GEORGE: Nope.

JERRY: Because I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?

GEORGE: Hey, a shoe buffing machine!

JERRY: I don't know, six three. George, how tall is Kramer?

GEORGE: You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body lotion!

JERRY: About six three.

GEORGE: Oh, a shower cap!



JERRY: Coming.



LUPE: Hello. I have more towels.

GEORGE: Oh good good, come in come in, welcome. I'm George and this is Jerry over there on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?

LUPE: Lupe.

GEORGE: Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?

Lupe: Yes.

GEORGE: Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

LUPE: Oh, yes yes.

GEORGE: Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.

LUPE: Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.

GEORGE: Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?

LUPE: It's too tight.



LUPE: Him too?

GEORGE: Uh Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?

JERRY: Excuse me, what?

GEORGE: You want your blankets tucked in?

JERRY: What blankets?

GEORGE: When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.

JERRY: I don't know, whatever they do.

Lupe: I tuck in? Yes?

JERRY: Tuck in, tuck in.

GEORGE: Alright, so that's one tuck and one no tuck.

LUPE: Okay.

GEORGE: Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.

JERRY: Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no tuck.

GEORGE: Two no tucks.

JERRY: Uh, hang on a second. You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.

GEORGE: You just said you weren't tucking.

JERRY: I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.

GEORGE: Alrighty. So, that's one tuck and one no tuck. Got that?

JERRY: Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?

LUPE: Oh yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.

JERRY: Oh, okay, thanks.

LUPE: Thank you.

GEORGE: Thank you.

LUPE: Bye bye.

GEORGE: Alright Lupe, bye bye now.

LUPE: Bye.

GEORGE: Bye bye.



JERRY: I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.

GEORGE: Well what did you want her to do? You left it on the night table.

JERRY: They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!

GEORGE: Hey hey hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.

JERRY: Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.

GEORGE: Alright. Now what mood am I in, what mood am I in?




GEORGE: You shouldn't have tucked.

JERRY: I like it tucked.

GEORGE: Nobody tucks anymore.






CRIMESCENEOFFICER: Hey, Lieutenant.

LTMARTEL: Yeah.

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: This was found on her person.

LTMARTEL: On her person? What kind of expression is that?

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: I don't know, sir. Police lingo.

LTMARTEL: Oh yeah? What's your name, son.

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: Ross.

LTMARTEL: Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: Yes sir.

LTMARTEL: She's dead. Have you got that?

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: Yes sir.

LTMARTEL: Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.

CRIMESCENEOFFICER: Yes sir.



LTMARTEL: I think we just caught a break.




GEORGE: This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: Might meet a celebrity.

JERRY: I can't believe she threw out my napkin.

GEORGE: What are you worried about, you know it.

JERRY: You gonna be alright here?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.

JERRY: Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.

GEORGE: Go go go, don't worry about it.



GEORGE: Hey. Corbin Bernsen.

CORBINBERNSEN: How you doing?

GEORGE: Big fan! Big fan.

CORBINBERNSEN: Yeah.

GEORGE: Hey, you grew a beard, huh?

CORBINBERNSEN: Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.

GEORGE: Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.

CORBINBERNSEN: Really.



GEORGE: ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.

CORBINBERNSEN: Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?

GEORGE: Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.

CORBINBERNSEN: So you killed the cat.

GEORGE: That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me like, uh, I don't know, get the hell out of here and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on la Law?






GEORGE: I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.

GEORGEWENDT: Oh, of course not.

GEORGE: But really, it's enough with the bar already.

GEORGEWENDT: Yeah, well.

GEORGE: Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?

GEORGEWENDT: Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.

GEORGE: Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?

GEORGEWENDT: Well yeah, they do.

GEORGE: What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.



GEORGEWENDT: Yeah, you ought to write one of those.

GEORGE: Yeah?

GEORGEWENDT: Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...

GEORGE: Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!



JERRY: How's it going?

GEORGE: Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!

JERRY: You got toilet paper on your heel there.










CORBINBERNSEN: Oh yeah yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law. Just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a great case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.






HELENA: He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.




GEORGEWENDT: It's funny, because even after all these years we still get people giving us advice how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there. He said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.






HIPPIEONE: So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?




GEORGEWENDT: The guy you talked to, what did he look like?

CORBINBERNSEN: Short little bald guy with glasses.

GEORGEWENDT: Yeah yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.

CORBINBERNSEN: It never ends, does it?




JERRY: So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.








LTMARTEL: Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this uh, Kramer.




JERRY: I was terrible.

GEORGE: What are you, crazy? You were fine.

JERRY: Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the uh...

GEORGE: Conveyor belt.

JERRY: Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.

GEORGE: I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?

JERRY: Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.



TVNEWSCASTER: Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called "Smog Stranglings". Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".








JERRY: Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show. You know, they're always looking off camera, "Do we have time? Are we out of time? How we doing on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's the time?  Check the time?" You never see Magnum PI go, "Should I strangle this guy or are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? I'll tell you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us."
