

JERRY: To me government is basically parents or adults, especially the IRS. The IRS is like Ward and June Cleaver and we're all Wally and the Beaver and your accountant is Eddy Hascal showing you all these neat tricks to get away with stuff. Which is fine unless you get audited then you don't want some wise guy in a suit just standing there going, "You have a very lovely office here sir." Because jail is the government's way of sending you to your room and when you meet Whitey and Lumpy in the joint, there's really gonna be something wrong with the Beaver.






JERRY: So, does he like you?

ELAINE: What do you think?

JERRY: You like him?

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.

GEORGE: So, what's wrong with him?

ELAINE: Nothing, and I've looked.

GEORGE: Well, I'm sure you'll find something.

JERRY: So, how did you meet him?

ELAINE: In the office.

JERRY: So, he's a writer.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah, big surprise.

ELAINE: So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.

GEORGE: What are those?

ELAINE: Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.



JERRY: So, what did you do?

ELAINE: I said, "So, what do you think?" And he said, "Gabardine?" And I said, "Yeah." That was it.

GEORGE: Wow, just felt your material?

ELAINE: Yeah. Jake Jarmel.

GEORGE: Sounds like a cool guy.

JERRY: Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.

GEORGE: Jerry, where did you get that sweater?

JERRY: Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.

GEORGE: I think that's what the back of closets are for.



ELAINE: Hey, that's Barry. Look its Barry.



JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Who's that?

JERRY: That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.

GEORGE: I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.

ELAINE: Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.



JERRY: Hey Barry, how you doing?

BARRY: Hey, how are you?



JERRY: This is my friend George.

BARRY: Hi George.



ELAINE: Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?

BARRY: Nothing really.



BARRY: You uh, you eat here?

JERRY: Yeah, so how's my money?

BARRY: Well it's still green.



JERRY: What, you got a cold?

BARRY: No no.

ELAINE: Wow, look at that ring.

BARRY: Oh, uh, you like that?



BARRY: Say uh, where's the bathroom?

JERRY: Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh, right over there.

BARRY: Oh, great.



JERRY: Did you see that?

ELAINE: See what?

GEORGE: Yes, I saw that.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: What was all that sniffing?

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: You don't think?

ELAINE: Oh no! Come on Jerry.

GEORGE: He was definitely sniffing.

JERRY: I mean what if, what if, this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.

ELAINE: No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.

JERRY: Then, what was all that sniffing?

ELAINE: Maybe it's the cold weather.

JERRY: Today's not cold.

GEORGE: Alright, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.

ELAINE: Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.




FRANK: Why do you need all that ketchup for?

GEORGE: This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.

FRANK: So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.

ESTELLE: Phil Casacof?

FRANK: Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.

GEORGE: Next Friday? What time?

FRANK: Two o'clock.

GEORGE: That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.

FRANK: You can look for sneakers the next day!

ESTELLE: He doesn't know anything about bras.

GEORGE: I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?

FRANK: Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is your bra? Give him a bra to look.

ESTELLE: I am not giving him a bra.

FRANK: Why not?

ESTELLE: Because I don't need him looking at my bra.

FRANK: Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!

GEORGE: Do we have to?

FRANK: You don't even know what they're made from.

GEORGE: They are made from lycra spandex.

FRANK: Get out of here! Lycra spandex?

ESTELLE: I think they are made from lycra spandex.

FRANK: Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?

ESTELLE: I'm not betting!

FRANK: Take a look.

ESTELLE: Alright, I'll get a bra.



FRANK: I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!

GEORGE: She doesn't want to get a bra.

FRANK: I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.

GEORGE: Alright, it wouldn't kill me.

FRANK: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds. You know about the uh, cup sizes and all? They have different cups.

GEORGE: Yeah I, I know about the cups.

FRANK: You got the A, the B, the C, and the D. That's the biggest.

GEORGE: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.

ESTELLE: Here, here's the bra.

FRANK: Let me see it.

ESTELLE: One hundred percent lycra spandex.

FRANK: Let me see it.

ESTELLE: I told you. Here, think you know everything?

FRANK: Hmm, that's surprising. Alright, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. Alright, I guess that's about it.

GEORGE: I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.



ESTELLE: You got ketchup on it!






KRAMER: Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?

JERRY: Sniffing, with his nose.

KRAMER: Jerry, he probably had a cold.

JERRY: No, I asked him.

KRAMER: So, what are you saying?

JERRY: I don't know, you know, what if?

KRAMER: Drugs? You think he's on drugs?

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Jerry.

JERRY: All I know he was sniffing.

KRAMER: Listen, we went in on a CD together.

JERRY: I know.

KRAMER: And Newman gave you money too. So I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.

JERRY: Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.

KRAMER: Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word "man"?

JERRY: No, he didn't use "man".

KRAMER: I mean when he was leaving did he say, "I'm splitting"?

JERRY: No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.

KRAMER: Whoa!

JERRY: Do you think that's a bad sign?

KRAMER: Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! Alright, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?

JERRY: I don't know.



JERRY: This sweater really itches me. You want it?

KRAMER: Yeah.




ELAINE: Hello hello, oh...

JAKE: Well, you notice anything?

ELAINE: You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.



JAKE: Oh.

ELAINE: Did anyone call?

JAKE: You got a few messages, I wrote them down.

ELAINE: Where are they?

JAKE: Lets see, they are...



JAKE: ...here they are.

ELAINE: Thank you.



ELAINE: Oh yeah, huh, I'll call you back. Oh, Myra had the baby! Oh my God, that's wonderful! Who called?

JAKE: She did.

ELAINE: She did? Oh, that's so great!

JAKE: Where do you keep the corkscrew?

ELAINE: In the drawer on the right. Hmm.

JAKE: What?

ELAINE: Nah, it's nothing.

JAKE: What is it?

ELAINE: It's nothing.

JAKE: Tell me.

ELAINE: Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point.

JAKE: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.

JAKE: So?

ELAINE: So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.

JAKE: What's so curious about it?

ELAINE: Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.

JAKE: Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.

ELAINE: You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.

JAKE: Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.

ELAINE: I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.

JAKE: Okay, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.

ELAINE: Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation point at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!

JAKE: Well, you can put one on this one. I'm leaving!






JERRY: You're out of your mind you know that.

ELAINE: Why?

JERRY: It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.

ELAINE: Well, I felt a call for one.

JERRY: A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.

ELAINE: I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.

JERRY: George was right. Didn't take you long.



KRAMER: Anything new with that guy on drugs?

ELAINE: Oh, he's not on drugs.

KRAMER: Then why the sniffing? Who walks around sniffing?

ELAINE: Alright, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.

JERRY: Good idea.





JERRY: Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.



JERRY: Out of town?



JERRY: South America?

KRAMER: South America?

JERRY: I'll call back, thank you.



JERRY: He went to South America!

KRAMER: Yeah!!

ELAINE: So what?

JERRY: Who goes to South America?

ELAINE: People go to South America.

JERRY: Yeah, and they come back with things taped to their large intestine.

ELAINE: So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?

JERRY: Yes, I'm impugning a continent.

KRAMER: Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!



NEWMAN: Hey, hey.

JERRY: Hello Newman.

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. So, any news?

KRAMER: Yeah, he skipped out and went to South America!

NEWMAN: South America?! What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?

ELAINE: Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.

KRAMER: Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.

ELAINE: Oh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on.

JERRY: Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out.

NEWMAN: If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.








KRAMER: What's today?

NEWMAN: It's Thursday.

KRAMER: Really? Feels like Tuesday.

NEWMAN: Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....

KRAMER: I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...

JERRY: Alright, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.

NEWMAN: Hey, you know this is kind of fun.

KRAMER: Yeah, maybe we ought to become private detectives.

JERRY: Yeah maybe you should.

KRAMER: Maybe I will.

NEWMAN: Yeah, me too.

JERRY: Alright, what are you gonna say to him?

KRAMER: Just gonna find out if he's interested.

NEWMAN: Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?

JERRY: No, you stay here in the car.

NEWMAN: Who made you the leader?

JERRY: Alright Newman, one more peep out of you, you're out of the whole operation!

NEWMAN: Alright.

JERRY: There he is. He's going into that bar.

KRAMER: Alright, I'm going in.

JERRY: Be careful Kramer.



NEWMAN: I should have gone in with him.

JERRY: No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.

NEWMAN: What you need me in the car for?

JERRY: I might need you to get me a soda.






KRAMER: I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.

MITCH: The name's Mitch.

KRAMER: Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?

BARRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things.



KRAMER: Cigarette?



BARRY: No, I never touch them.

KRAMER: I suck them down like Coca Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time.



KRAMER: Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fellow?

BARRY: I don't think so.

KRAMER: Me neither.








JERRY: You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.

NEWMAN: I use dental tape.

JERRY: You should try this.

NEWMAN: I don't wanna.

JERRY: Not even once?

NEWMAN: No.

JERRY: You're an idiot.

NEWMAN: Why, because I use dental tape?

JERRY: Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.




KRAMER: South America?

BARRY: Yeah, yeah.

KRAMER: Well that's a burgeoning continent.

BARRY: Well, they are expanding their economic base.

KRAMER: Tell me about it.



BARRY: Excuse me, I gotta go to the bathroom.

KRAMER: I'm hip.

BARRY: Hip to the what?

KRAMER: To the whole scene.



BARRY: What scene?

KRAMER: The bathroom scene.

BARRY: Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming back I'm sitting over there.

KRAMER: What ever turns you on.






NEWMAN: No no, I don't like it.

JERRY: What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?

NEWMAN: I like the thick tape.








BARRY: Hey!! What kind of a nut are you?




FARKUS: So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.

GEORGE: Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus. Very much indeed, sir.

FARKUS: Have you ever sold a woman's line before?

GEORGE: No, but um, I have very good rapport with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassiere, I was enthralled.

FARKUS: Hmm. tell me about it.

GEORGE: Well, I was fourteen years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.

FARKUS: That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.

GEORGE: Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?

FARKUS: Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at Ed Granmont.

GEORGE: Thank you Mr. Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.

FARKUS: See you Monday nine o'clock.

GEORGE: If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at eight.

FARKUS: Excellent.

GEORGE: So long, Mr. Farkus.



MSDEGRANMONT: What you're think you're doing?

GEORGE: Oh, nothing.

MSDEGRANMONT: Farkus, get out here!

FARKUS: Yes, Ms. De Granmont?

MSDEGRANMONT: Farkus, who is this pervert little weasel?

FARKUS: Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman.



FARKUS: He's supposed to start on Monday.

MSDEGRANMONT: If he's here on Monday, you're not. Take a pick.

FARKUS: Get out! I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont.




ELAINE: You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?

MRLIPPMAN: I was just uh, going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.

ELAINE: Yes, yes I did.

MRLIPPMAN: And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.

ELAINE: Uh, well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.

MRLIPPMAN: Ah, "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"

ELAINE: Right, well...

MRLIPPMAN: You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?

ELAINE: That's, that's correct, I, I felt that the character doesn't like to be chilly...

MRLIPPMAN: I see, "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?

ELAINE: Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters into the machine and then nothing comes out...

MRLIPPMAN: Get rid of the exclamation points.

ELAINE: Okay, okay, okay.

MRLIPPMAN: I hate exclamation points.

ELAINE: Okay, I'll just...






JERRY: "Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately."

KRAMER: Exclamation point.

ELAINE: You still have no proof.

KRAMER: Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.

JERRY: "I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the eighteenth".

KRAMER: Double exclamation point!

NEWMAN: Will that take care of ours too?

JERRY: Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.

NEWMAN: Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.

JERRY: Yeah, thanks.

NEWMAN: It'll be my pleasure.



NEWMAN: See you later.

JERRY: You know this...



KRAMER: Hey, Ralph.

JERRY: Hi Ralph.

RALPH: What's up fellows? That'll be fourteen thirty.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah.



KRAMER: What's the matter? You've got a cold?

RALPH: No man.



RALPH: Kramer, what is this?

KRAMER: It's a sweater.

RALPH: What is it made out of?

KRAMER: I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.

JERRY: Mohair, I think.

RALPH: Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.

JERRY: You mean you just started sniffing?

RALPH: Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.



JERRY: I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.

KRAMER: Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.

ELAINE: The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.

JERRY: Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!

KRAMER: Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.



JERRY: The what??






NEWMAN: After you.

MAILBOXWOMAN: Thank you.



MAILBOXWOMAN: Get your hands off of me! Johnny! Johnny!






FRANK: What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?

GEORGE: So what, what is so bad about that?

ESTELLE: Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!

FRANK: What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!






ELAINE: You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.



JERRY: Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.

ELAINE: What is this?

JERRY: It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. He is filing a chapter eleven.

ELAINE: Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?

JERRY: Bankruptcy, bankruptcy... as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!

ELAINE: What do you mean? I thought it was the sweater.

KRAMER: Alright, What about the money?

JERRY: What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!



NEWMAN: Pair of bearclaws, please.



SHIRTFEELERWOMAN: Nice.

JERRY: Think so?

SHIRTFEELERWOMAN: Yeah, what is it?

JERRY: Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?




JERRY: My accountant actually did take a big chunk of money from me and use it to buy drugs and the thing that was hardest for me to comprehend about this is the life choice of drug abuse and accounting. But actually it makes sense. I mean why would an athlete or a musician take drugs? They have an interesting job but an accountant if ever a job required some hallucinogenic support this is the job. That should be the legal defense, you're in court, "You're charged with possession of illegal narcotics." "But you're honor, I'm an accountant." "Bang, case closed. Bailiff, give this man back his peyote buttons and tequila back for the drive home. Sorry to bother you sir, terribly sorry."
