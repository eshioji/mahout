

JERRY: The whole concept of being separated to me is strange, it�s like you�re engaged to be divorced. We�re gonna try making not being together work. First we we�re separated, then we met, then we were together, now we are gonna try being separated again. We actually think some kind of giant rubber band might be the best solution. Of course when you were a kid in school you would get separated for having too good of a time, "If you too kids don't stop laughing and having fun I�m gonna have to separate you." Then the kid finds out his parents are breaking up and he thinks it's because they got caught fooling around, which is probably true.






JERRY: Hairdo?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: You look like Brenda Starr.

ELAINE: Is that good?

JERRY: It's better than Gandhi.



ELAINE: Hey, my God, look at that.



ELAINE: David and Beth Lickner.



ELAINE: You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

JERRY: You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lickner.

ELAINE: Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of spongeworthy.

JERRY: Yeah, I've been waiting out their marriage for three years.

ELAINE: Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.



GEORGE: This car out there is taking up like three parking spaces.



ELAINE: Oh, that's mine.

GEORGE: You have a car?

ELAINE: Well, my friend Elise lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.

JERRY: You know, I've never seen you drive.

GEORGE: Me either.



BETH: Jerry? Elaine, Hi!

ELAINE: Hi, David!

JERRY: Hi, Beth!

BETH: Oh, uh, George, this is my husband, David.

GEORGE: Oh, hi.



DAVIDLICKNER: Hello. So George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?

GEORGE: Yeah. Why, what do you do?

DAVIDLICKNER: Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.

GEORGE: Really?

BETH: Mmm hmm.

DAVIDLICKNER: Yeah.

GEORGE: A physician married to a salesman. Well, I gotta tell you Beth, you could of done a lot better than him.








KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?

MICKEY: I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: It's a method, Jerry. It's intense.

MICKEY: Kramer's going to be my scene partner.

JERRY: Kramer?

MICKEY: He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.

KRAMER: Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.

JERRY: Oh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So...

KRAMER: Yeah. Look at this, Mickey. These pants are falling apart, huh?

JERRY: You know, when I first met you Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.

KRAMER: Yeah, well I was a different man then.

JERRY: With a different body.

KRAMER: Hey, I got the body of a taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.



JERRY: Eh, I don't know.

KRAMER: Now, what are you thinking? You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're saying? Because if that's what you're saying Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.



KRAMER: I swear to God I will!



KRAMER: Don't think I won't, Jerry!






ELAINE: God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much!



ELAINE: How about a left turn signal, you moron!



ELAINE: Whoa.

JERRY: I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.

ELAINE: You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. I think it was a golden retriever. No no no, it was a, it was a yellow lab.



ELAINE: I'm gonna check my messages.





JERRY: I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!



ELAINE: Oh my God! Jerry! My friend Kim called. David and Beth got separated last night!

JERRY: Huh?

ELAINE: They're getting divorced!








ELAINE: So now, what is our move? What do we do?

JERRY: I don't know, but we don't have much time.

ELAINE: Mmm.

JERRY: The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.

ELAINE: Right.

JERRY: It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building, you gotta take immediate action.

ELAINE: Yeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.

JERRY: Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.

JERRY: But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.

ELAINE: Then why are we calling?

JERRY: Good question. Why are we calling?



ELAINE: Ah! I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."

JERRY: "I'm there for you."

ELAINE: Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just "there".






ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.

GEORGE: Really? Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?

JERRY: What'd you say?

GEORGE: You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just being folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy?

ELAINE: Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.

GEORGE: Totally folksy.



JERRY: Hey, uh...



JERRY: What'd you get there?

KRAMER: Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.

ELAINE: Kramer, they're painted on!

KRAMER: Well, they're slim fit.

JERRY: Slim fit?

KRAMER: Yeah, they're streamlined.

JERRY: You're walking like Frankenstein!

KRAMER: What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. Alright, see you later.








ELAINE: Well David, it happens.



JERRY: Sure Beth, these things happen. So, have you told many people yet?



ELAINE: Because it's really nobody's business.



JERRY: Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.



ELAINE: "There" is um, anywhere you want me to be.



JERRY: Sure, dinner would be fine.



ELAINE: And I could just be there. For you.



KRAMER: Jerry, you gotta help me!

JERRY: What's wrong?

KRAMER: I can't get my pants off and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!

JERRY: Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.

KRAMER: Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck.



JERRY: You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.



KRAMER: Pull down.

JERRY: Alright, alright, that's no good.



JERRY: Let me try getting them from the bottom.



JERRY: Just give me one leg.



KRAMER: Wait, Jerry. Wait a minute.

JERRY: Man these are tight.



JERRY: Squinch your hips in.

KRAMER: I am squinching my hips!

JERRY: Squinch them!

KRAMER: I... um...

JERRY: Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.



KRAMER: You better get me.



KRAMER: Get me up, get me up, get me up.

JERRY: Hold it, hold it. Look, your gonna need the Jaws of Life to get out of those things.

KRAMER: Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.

JERRY: Maybe you can soak in the tub.

KRAMER: You better get the door.







BETH: It was nice to get your call.

JERRY: Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when I'm not here for you, I'm there for you.

BETH: Well where ever you are I appreciate it.

JERRY: So how did this all happen?

BETH: Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment.

JERRY: Is that right?

BETH: I thought maybe I could do better.

JERRY: Maybe, maybe.

BETH: Well it wasn't just that, I realized after three years of marriage that David's little quirks were getting on my nerves a little.

JERRY: Well three years is a long time to be married.

BETH: Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself, aloud. And then answers them.




DAVIDLICKNER: Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely.

ELAINE: You're gonna pick up the pieces.

DAVIDLICKNER: Just had our third anniversary on April eighth.

ELAINE: Tenth.

DAVIDLICKNER: Right.

ELAINE: Right.

DAVIDLICKNER: You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault.

ELAINE: Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.






CASTINGDIRECTOR: Alright, auditioning next is Mickey Abbott.



CASTINGDIRECTOR: Doing a scene from the Terrance Clifford play, "Press wounds in Ithaca"

MICKEY: Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh...



MICKEY: Oh.

KRAMER: Hey, sorry I'm late.

MICKEY: What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man.

KRAMER: I know, it's a long story.

MICKEY: Well just get up there.



MICKEY: So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself. Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat.



MICKEY: You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours... I said sit down!



MICKEY: Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down!

KRAMER: I'm trying.

MICKEY: Bradley! It's very important that you sit down.



MICKEY: Now for the last time, try again to sit down!



MICKEY: Sit down you big stupid Ape! 







ELAINE: Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did.



ELAINE: Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.

JERRY: I'll tell you, that there for you crap was a stroke of genius.

ELAINE: Oh, please.

JERRY: Never mind.

ELAINE: Ah come on.

JERRY: You're a genius!

ELAINE: Alright!



ELAINE: Mmm, Georgie!



GEORGE: What, what's going on?

JERRY: What's going on? You're the man of the hour, that's what's going on.

ELAINE: Right.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

ELAINE: Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up before they know what hit them.



GEORGE: So it was my comment that broke them up?



JERRY: According to them.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no.



JERRY: Where are you going?

GEORGE: Well I gotta go talk to Beth.

JERRY: Talk to Beth?

GEORGE: Well I gotta undo what I did.

JERRY: You're not undoing anything.

GEORGE: Oh yes I am.

JERRY: Oh no you're not!



GEORGE: Alright get out of my way.



GEORGE: Alright don't make me get physical here!



ELAINE: You be careful George.










BETH: George?!

GEORGE: Hi Beth. Um anyway, Jerry told me that uh, it might have been my comment in the coffee shop that broke you up.

BETH: Oh, well you know its funny George. Sometimes you don't know how you're really feeling about something until a person like you comes along and articulates it so perfectly.

GEORGE: Oh, articulate... me? I've never articulated anything, I'm completely incoherent.



BETH: I don't know about that. Hold on.



BETH: Hello? Hi. Yeah, last night I had a good time too. Really? That's so funny he's here right now.

JERRY: Could you put him on? I'd love to say hello.

BETH: Sure.



BETH: George, its Jerry.

GEORGE: He, he wants to talk to me?

BETH: Yeah, he says he wants to say hello.

GEORGE: Sweet guy.



GEORGE: Hello?

JERRY: George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!

GEORGE: Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually I already ate.

JERRY: Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear...

GEORGE: Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: Oh of course you can use it, sure. Okay, bye.










KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, are you still wearing those things?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit.



KRAMER: Oh, hi Mrs. Zanfino.

MRSZANFINO: Oh Kramer, would you do me a favor? My baby sitter hasn't show up could you come watch Joey for an hour I gotta run out.

KRAMER: Sure Mrs. Zanfino, yeah.

MRSZANFINO: He's sleeping already, you don't have to do anything, just wait till I get back.

KRAMER: See you later buddy.

JERRY: See you later.



JERRY: Hello?

BETH: Hi Jerry, its Beth.

JERRY: Oh, hi Beth

BETH: Hi, I've been doing a lot of thinking today and I don't know maybe I made a huge mistake.

JERRY: George.



BETH: I'm feeling really confused.

JERRY: Um. I'll call you back okay?

BETH: Okay.



JERRY: Trouble.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: George.

ELAINE: Is it?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Damn.

JERRY: What are we gonna do?

ELAINE: What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.

JERRY: Yeah, I could try and do that.

ELAINE: You don't try, you do it! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go. I'll drive you over there. Come on.

JERRY: No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.

ELAINE: What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on.



ELAINE: Come on.

JERRY: No no, I'll take the subway.



ELAINE: Nah, it doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.

JERRY: Nah, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.

ELAINE: What's your problem?

JERRY: It's really not necessary.








GEORGE: The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well.

SUSAN: Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for you.

GEORGE: Should be a while though.






ELAINE: Whoa, ah. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.

JERRY: I don't feel so good.




JERRY: Anyway Beth, you know I was thinking on my way over how when I was nine. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know I never got the sneakers.



BETH: Oh really?




ELAINE: My father left us when I was nine so I guess that is why I have such a fear of abandonment.

DAVIDLICKNER: Wow that's so touching.

ELAINE: Yes it is.





DAVIDLICKNER: Hey, it's George.

ELAINE: Oh, maybe we should go some place else.

DAVIDLICKNER: No, let's go in.



GEORGE: Oh uh hi, hi David.

DAVIDLICKNER: Hi George.

GEORGE: Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment.

DAVIDLICKNER: George please, please I'm fine.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, this is my fiancee, Susan. This is David.

SUSAN: David.

DAVIDLICKNER: Oh fiancee. Boy you could of done a lot better than him. Come on Elaine, let's go.










LITTLEJOEY: Ah! It's Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

KRAMER: Joey! Joey!






MICKEYSGIRL: Mickey you were so incredible in that scene yesterday, the rage.

MICKEY: Right, the rage. Tons of rage.



KRAMER: I don't believe this.







MICKEY: Hello?

KRAMER: Mickey.

MICKEY: Oh hi Kramer. What do you want? I'm a little busy.

KRAMER: Look, you gotta do me a favor.

MICKEY: What? Now? I can't.

KRAMER: Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.

MICKEY: Oh alright, alright. I'll be right over.




GEORGE: Oh uh, you ready?

SUSAN: You know what George, uh, why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.

GEORGE: Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh, things, ponder things, you know, ruminant. You go ahead, lot of stuff on your mind. You think things out, think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling.




KRAMER: I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back. Here.



KRAMER: Keep the covers over you.

MICKEY: Why don't you just cut the stupid pants and get them off already?

KRAMER: I'm breaking them in and they're feeling better.

MICKEY: What am I gonna do in here?

KRAMER: Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.




GEORGE: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, I'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces.



GEORGE: So in walks, in walks David, right, he walks right to the table. I introduced him to Susan and he says get this, he says, "Boy, you could do a lot better than this guy," huh, right?



GEORGE: The exact same thing that I said to him just to get back at me, just to get back at me. And then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile. Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better. Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?

JERRY: I'm nauseous.

GEORGE: Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?

JERRY: A little.

GEORGE: Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?

JERRY: It's not bad.

GEORGE: Yeah.






KRAMER: Joey, there you are. Hey.

LITTLEJOEY: Ah!!

KRAMER: Joey!



LITTLEJOEY: A monster!

KRAMER: I'm the babysitter!




MRSZANFINO: Goodnight, honey.

MICKEY: Goodnight.




JERRY: It's gotta have something to do with Kramer.






DAVIDLICKNER: Elaine, here's to you being there.

ELAINE: And here.



DAVIDLICKNER: Excuse me.



DAVIDLICKNER: Beth!

BETH: David!





ELAINE: I'll tell you, it's not bad.








SUSAN: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

SUSAN: Can I talk to you for a minute?

GEORGE: Yeah, sure sure.

SUSAN: I've been doing a lot of thinking about the wedding and all and uh...



SUSAN: I've decided to go with the chicken.






OFFICERHAVEY: So chasing little kids huh? You're in a lot of trouble mister.

KRAMER: No no look, I was babysitting.

OFFICERHAVEY: Yeah yeah, right. Sit down!



OFFICERHAVEY: What are you deaf? I said sit down!



OFFICERHAVEY: Hey, for the last time, sit down!

KRAMER: Yeah yeah.
