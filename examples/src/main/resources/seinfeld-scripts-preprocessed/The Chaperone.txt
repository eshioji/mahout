Always baseball. As far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires. I feel if you're on the field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from these games, "We won! We won!" No, they won, you watched.




GEORGE: Okay Danny, take a swing.



GEORGE: No no no, you're opening up your shoulder.

TARTABULL: Really?

GEORGE: No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!

TARTABULL: Alright, alright.



GEORGE: What are all sweating for?

TARTABULL: It's hot in this uniform.

GEORGE: Hot?



GEORGE: What is this?

TARTABULL: What is what?

GEORGE: This uniform, what's it made from?

TARTABULL: I don't know, cotton?

GEORGE: No. This is not cotton. Here, let me see.



GEORGE: Will you stop it?



GEORGE: Oh, Of course. Polyester!

TARTABULL: So?

GEORGE: I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.

TARTABULL: Well, this is what they give us.

GEORGE: You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?

TARTABULL: You really think cotton's better?

GEORGE: Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.

TARTABULL: Yeah, good idea. Catch you later.



GEORGE: Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands.








ELAINE: Oh, you want one?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: I'll get it.



JERRY: That's alright, I got it.

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: Elaine, stop it.

ELAINE: Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. Yo! Dogs! Two!

JERRY: I'm sorry.





JERRY: Now there's a career path you may have overlooked.

ELAINE: Oh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.

JERRY: Oh, she worked at Doubleday?

ELAINE: Yeah, she was an editor.

JERRY: Right, just like you.

ELAINE: Yeah. Can you hold my seat?









JERRY: Hot dog?

KAREN: No thanks, I'm watching my weight.

JERRY: Ah, I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...

KAREN: Rhode Island.

JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed.






GEORGE: Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?

JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.

GEORGE: You're incredible.

JERRY: And get this, I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend and she's going to be down there for the pageant.

GEORGE: What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!

JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.

GEORGE: Chaperone? What, are you kidding?

JERRY: No, it's part of the contest rules.

GEORGE: What does the chaperone do?

JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.

GEORGE: Can she talk?

JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.



GEORGE: You're calling her?

JERRY: Yeah. There she is... Miss... yes, room four seventeen please? Karen Hanson?

GEORGE: Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?

JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.

GEORGE: Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.

JERRY: Why do they wear polyester?

GEORGE: I don't know. That's all gonna change.

JERRY: You're going to do something about it?

GEORGE: Why shouldn't I?

JERRY: No reason.




LANDIS: Of course, Jackie O was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such... grace.

ELAINE: Yes! Grace!

LANDIS: Not many people have grace.

ELAINE: Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace, not as much as Jackie...

LANDIS: You can't have "a little grace." You either have grace, or you don't.

ELAINE: Okay, fine, I have no grace.

LANDIS: And you can't acquire grace.

ELAINE: Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.

LANDIS: Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.

ELAINE: Alright, alright, look, I don't have grace, I don't want grace, I don't even say grace, okay?

LANDIS: Thank you for coming in.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, right.

LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days and we'll let you know.

ELAINE: I have no chance, do I?

LANDIS: No.





ELAINE: Justin Pitt?

LANDIS: He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.

ELAINE: Mrs. Onassis's? That's hard to pronounce.

LANDIS: Excuse me?

ELAINE: Nothing.



MRPITT: Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.

LANDIS: Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes.





MRPITT: Charmed.

ELAINE: I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onassis, sis, sis...




JERRY: Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. The chaperone can't make it. Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So we're not going?



JERRY: Hold on one second. Hey, what are you doing tonight?

KRAMER: Nothing.

JERRY: I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?

KRAMER: What state?

JERRY: Rhode Island.

KRAMER: They're never in contention.

GEORGE: How do you know?

KRAMER: Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.

JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.

KRAMER: Giddy up!

JERRY: I think I got someone!




MRPITT: The resemblance is uncanny.



MRPITT: Even the brown eyes.

ELAINE: Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.

MRPITT: No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.

ELAINE: Grace?

MRPITT: Grace, yes.

ELAINE: You think I have grace?

MRPITT: Some grace, yes.

ELAINE: Just some?

MRPITT: Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.



ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Pitt.

MRPITT: Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.




GEORGE: Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?

SHOWALTER: Sure, George.

GEORGE: How's everything going? Everything okay?

SHOWALTER: Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing.

GEORGE: Listen Buck, I uh, obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh, I've been talking to some of the guys and some of them, I don't want to mention any names, but some of them, they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.

SHOWALTER: How so?

GEORGE: Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fiber. I think they would prefer cotton.

SHOWALTER: Cotton, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable, they're happier, they're gonna play better.

SHOWALTER: You may have something there, George.

GEORGE: Oh, I've got something.

SHOWALTER: Hmm, cotton uniforms.




JERRY: Congratulations!

ELAINE: Yeah! And the best part is I still get to look for work in publishing.

JERRY: Now, what is it that you do exactly?

ELAINE: I attend to his personal affairs.

JERRY: Like what?

ELAINE: Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh, I have to buy him some socks.

JERRY: Really! Socks!

ELAINE: Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.

JERRY: Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear!



KRAMER: So, what do you think? Does this work?

JERRY: Listen, tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night" if you know what I mean.

KRAMER: No way!

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.

JERRY: I'm not going to defile her!

KRAMER: That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.

JERRY: But...



KRAMER: Ah! No buts! Those are my rules.

JERRY: But wait a minute...

KRAMER: Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out. If you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy!






KRAMER: If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?

KAREN: As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!

JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. Listen...

KRAMER: What advice would you give young people?

JERRY: Alright, Kramer!

KRAMER: This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think out there with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know poise counts.

KAREN: You really know a lot about this, don't you?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.

KAREN: Well, what could she have done?

KRAMER: Tape her breasts together.



KAREN: What else?

KRAMER: Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.

JERRY: Hey, come on!

KAREN: No, no it's okay. Go on.

KRAMER: Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.

KAREN: Really.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Just... suck you in.

JERRY: I'll be right back.



KRAMER: So, what's your talent?

KAREN: Magic.

KRAMER: Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.

KAREN: Six.

KRAMER: No, five. But you were close.



















KRAMER: How's your evening?

KAREN: Well, I'm wearing this red dress...

KRAMER: Stop right there.

KAREN: No good?

KRAMER: Disaster.

KAREN: Why?

KRAMER: Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.

KAREN: That makes sense.



JERRY: Well, here we are.

KAREN: Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?

KRAMER: Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.

KAREN: I am in your hands.



KAREN: Well! Oh, good night Jerry.



KAREN: Kenneth will take you home.



KRAMER: There she is, Miss...

JERRY: Oh, shut the



JERRY: up!




KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.

KRAMER: Oh, come on.

JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!

KRAMER: Oh, you're poo pooing!

JERRY: Yes, I poo poo.

KRAMER: Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown and you can't stop her!

JERRY: I don't want to stop her!

KRAMER: You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen them come and go, but this kid has got something!



JERRY: Yeah, so do you.



GEORGE: Well, did you see it?

JERRY: See what?

GEORGE: The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! "Wade Boggs. What a fabric! Finally we can breathe. Luis Palonia. Cotton is king. Paul O'Neill. I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy."

JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable.

GEORGE: Hey, where you going?

JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.

GEORGE: Really!

JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?

GEORGE: Atlantic City? Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.

JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, let me call her.



JERRY: She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number.




ELAINE: So, what do you think?

MRPITT: No.

ELAINE: You don't like them?

MRPITT: No, I don't like them.

ELAINE: What's wrong?

MRPITT: They're too tight.

ELAINE: Too tight?

MRPITT: There's no elastic, you need to pull too much.



ELAINE: I think they look good!

MRPITT: They're cutting off the circulation.

ELAINE: Alright, well, I'll just take them back.



MRPITT: Hello?

JERRY: Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?



MRPITT: It's for you.

ELAINE: Sorry. Hello?

JERRY: Hey Elaine, it's me.

ELAINE: Jerry?

JERRY: We're going to Atlantic City.

ELAINE: Really? When?

JERRY: Today, right now! Are you in?

ELAINE: One second, hang on. Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?

MRPITT: Tomorrow?

ELAINE: Yes.

MRPITT: But I was hoping for my new socks today!

ELAINE: Well, it's just one more day.

MRPITT: I'm sorry. I must have them today.

ELAINE: I can't go.

JERRY: Why not?

ELAINE: Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.

MRPITT: Elaine!

ELAINE: I gotta go.






KRAMER: No. Alright, watch me now.



KRAMER: Turn, back, head up, shoulders back, posture. You see? Posture.

KAREN: Yes, I see. Okay.

KRAMER: Let's try a few more questions, alright?



KRAMER: If you were Miss America, and the US was on the brink of a nuclear war and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?

KAREN: Kramer, are these questions really that important?

KRAMER: Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! Poise!




GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: How was the show?

JERRY: Good. How was the roulette?

GEORGE: I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.

JERRY: Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!




MRPITT: It's good, but...

ELAINE: But what?

MRPITT: Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.



ELAINE: No, no! They'll stay up!

MRPITT: For a while yes, but not in the long run.

ELAINE: But that's why I got you the tighter ones!



MRPITT: Oh, forget about those!



MRPITT: Why do you keep mentioning those?

ELAINE: What do you want!?

MRPITT: I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!






JERRY: What the hell is that?

GEORGE: I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!

JERRY: Well, I can't sleep with that noise.

GEORGE: Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?

JERRY: Wait a second.



JERRY: This'll scare them off.



JERRY: Well good night, Ollie.

GEORGE: Good night, Stan.




KRAMER: What is it?

KAREN: My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?

KRAMER: How did this happen?

KAREN: They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace, then I found them dead in a pool of water!



KRAMER: Well, how did this happen?

KAREN: It must have been an accident.

KRAMER: Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.




KRAMER: Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!

JERRY: What? Why? What happened?

KRAMER: Her birds are dead.

JERRY: Birds?

KRAMER: Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them!



JERRY: What are you looking at?



JERRY: Oh, that! We had to leave that outside last night because the water was making the room too cold.



KRAMER: You killed them, didn't you?

JERRY: No, you don't understand, it's not what you think! It was an accident!

KRAMER: Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!

JERRY: Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened!





GEORGE: What was that all about?

JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer. Apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.

GEORGE: Oh.






KAREN: Okay, this is it!

KRAMER: How you feeling?

KAREN: I'm a little nervous!

KRAMER: There's nothing to be nervous about.

KAREN: But I've never sung before in my life!

PHILBIN: And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!



JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.

GEORGE: That's a shame.



JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.

GEORGE: Hey, hey! Yankee game!



JERRY: Oh, great! Alright.











JERRY: That's a shame.



KRAMER: Poise. Poise!




JERRY: The Miss America pageant seems like a really tough contest. You know, you gotta come out there in the bathing suit, in the dress shoes, they got that "sanitized for your protection" toilet seat thing hanging off them, you know. Plus, they gotta wear all the other outfits. I don't know why, the bathing suit is the contest. You win with the bathing suit, you win. What is the formal wear? Everybody looks good in formal wear, it's dark, it covers everything, that's why we have weddings in it. I mean, if we had weddings in bathing suits, a lot of ceremonies wouldn't be able to get past, "If anyone sees any reason why these two people should not be joined together." About eighty hands go up.
