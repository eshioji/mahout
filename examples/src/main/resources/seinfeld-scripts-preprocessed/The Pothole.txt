



JENNA: Morning.

JERRY: Morning.



JENNA: Hope you don't mind baking soda flavor.

JERRY: Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. "I can do this. I can do that." Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?

JENNA: I'm gonna grab you a towel.







JERRY: Oh.




GEORGE: So?

JERRY: So? She used the toothbrush!

GEORGE: You said you grabbed it out of there real fast, right?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out and by the time the rest of them realized what was going on you had already grabbed it out.

JERRY: How many years of med school did you have?

GEORGE: Was she mad?



GEORGE: You didn't tell her.

JERRY: Jenna's like me. She's very...

GEORGE: Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?

JERRY: I'll take fastidious.



JERRY: What is that?

GEORGE: Ah, Steinbrenner gave them to us in honor of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.



JERRY: They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say "holy cow", do they?

GEORGE: Just the last few innings of a double header.



KRAMER: Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway going seventy and...



KRAMER: ...dragged this thing for five exits.



JERRY: Why didn't you pull over?

KRAMER: Well I was drafting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.



KRAMER: Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.






OWNER: China Panda.

ELAINE: Yeah, I'd like to place an order.

OWNER: Ah yes, what you like?

ELAINE: This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?

OWNER: What number?

ELAINE: Forty-seven.

OWNER: Yeah, first time. What else?

ELAINE: Uh, that's it.

OWNER: Address?

ELAINE: Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.

OWNER: That's Southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth.

ELAINE: I'm not below.

OWNER: Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.

ELAINE: Your guy can't cross to my side?

OWNER: If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street.

ELAINE: Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.

OWNER: Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary.





OWNER: China Panda.



ELAINE: Uh, yeah yeah. Uh, I'd like to place an order.

OWNER: Ah, what you like?






KRAMER: Well, I'm a poppa.

JERRY: Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.

KRAMER: Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.

JERRY: Oh, that adopt a highway thing.

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one fourteen.



JERRY: Aw, looks just like you.

KRAMER: Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.

JERRY: So what do you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?

KRAMER: They try to push you into using their cleaning crew with all their so called maintenance equipment.

JERRY: That old scam.

KRAMER: Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.

JERRY: At the side of the road with a pile of garbage.

KRAMER: Quality time.



GEORGE: Keys. I can't find my keys.

JERRY: You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!

GEORGE: Have you seen them?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Dammit!

KRAMER: Come on, retrace your steps. What did you do today?

GEORGE: I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.

KRAMER: Right.

JERRY: Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.

GEORGE: I don't have a spare set. All my keys say "do not duplicate".

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: So you can't duplicate them.



KRAMER: Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.






ELAINE: Oh. Oh hi. China Panda?

DELIVERYBOY: Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?

ELAINE: I thought that I would meet you halfway.



DELIVERYBOY: You really live here?

ELAINE: Oh yeah.



ELAINE: There you go, you keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.



ELAINE: This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!






JERRY: Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.

GEORGE: So the plan is to secretly sterilize her mouth?

JERRY: By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?

GEORGE: No, stings the throat.



GEORGE: Anyway, so I was coming along here and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!








GEORGE: Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.

JERRY: You didn't look down?

GEORGE: I was trying to stick the landing. Was right around here.



GEORGE: No! No!!



JERRY: Poor son of a bitch.






JERRY: It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.

JENNA: It's like I'm holding a blender.

JERRY: The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.



JERRY: Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.

JENNA: Really, it does?

JERRY: When the battery runs out.

JENNA: I was really happy with my old toothbrush.



JERRY: No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.



JENNA: That stuff tastes like bleach!



JERRY: I don't know anything about that.



JENNA: Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.

JERRY: That's the idea.



JERRY: You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.

JENNA: Aw. Okay. Thanks, I guess.






ELAINE: You still couldn't kiss her?

JERRY: She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.

ELAINE: Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.

JERRY: Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Of course, I would have that laser.

ELAINE: Jer, do you see where this is going?

JERRY: Being really clean and happy?

ELAINE: Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.

JERRY: Disorder?

ELAINE: And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full on dementia.

JERRY: Hmm, that could hurt me. Hey, there it is.





ELAINE: Shall we stop and say hi?

JERRY: Nah, we've seen it.

ELAINE: Yeah.






KRAMER: Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!



KRAMER: Mile one fourteen, clean as a whistle.











MAN: Yeah?

ELAINE: Hi. I'm your neighbor uh, from across the street. And uh, I was wondering if it wouldn't be too much trouble if I could use your apartment to order some food?

MAN: What? What do you want?

ELAINE: You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.

MAN: What, when is that?

ELAINE: No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kind of inside is all.

MAN: Who are you with?

ELAINE: No, actually I'm, I'm just kind of hungry.

MAN: Who let you in?

ELAINE: Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.










JERRY: What's with the signs?

KRAMER: Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air conditioners, shopping carts.



KRAMER: I just rolled them into the woods.

JERRY: Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.



KRAMER: Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there.



KRAMER: Those kids with the spray paint, God love them.



JERRY: Hey. So, keys?

GEORGE: No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.

JERRY: I guess they leave that up to the general population.

GEORGE: I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!

JERRY: Hard to say.

KRAMER: Hey, you need some roadwork done? Because I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car pool lane.



JERRY: Yeah?

JENNA: It's Jenna.



JERRY: If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.



GEORGE: You think you could hook me up with these guys?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven eight four.

GEORGE: Seven eight four.



JENNA: Hey.

JERRY: Hi.

JENNA: How you feeling?

JERRY: Good. My cold's gone and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.

JENNA: Okay.



JENNA: What?!

JERRY: Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.

JENNA: What?

JERRY: I'm sorry.

JENNA: When were you gonna tell me this?!

JERRY: Obviously never.



KRAMER: I need the yield sign.



JERRY: Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?



KRAMER: You could've introduced me.

JERRY: I wouldn't know where to start.



JERRY: Hey, Jenna. Hey!



JENNA: There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.

JERRY: What?! What, what'd you put in there?

JENNA: Gotta run.



JERRY: Oh man!






JERRY: Hello, Jenna? Did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!



ELAINE: She won't even give you a hint?

JERRY: No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.

ELAINE: You know what I bet it is? Your remote.

JERRY: Yes, that is a definite possibility.



ELAINE: Or, could be your walkman there.



JERRY: Are you just screwing with me?

ELAINE: Yeah, I am.



KRAMER: Hey ah.

JERRY: Hey, how's life on the road?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.

JERRY: I don't doubt it.



KRAMER: You should see the smiles on the driver�s faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.



JERRY: What's this?

KRAMER: Well, you know those annoying little bumps on the lane lines?



JERRY: Isn't that some kind of safety thing?

KRAMER: Well, I had to pull them up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.

JERRY: What the hell are you talking about?

KRAMER: Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one fourteen.



ELAINE: How are you gonna widen the lanes?

KRAMER: Well you black out lane lines one and three, and a four lane highway becomes a two lane comfort cruise. So, you got any black paint?

JERRY: Yeah, in my tool shed next to the riding mower.

ELAINE: Yeah, uh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one Q.

JERRY: One Q? Whose apartment is that?

ELAINE: That's the janitor closet, across the street.

JERRY: You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet just to get this flounder?

ELAINE: It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.



KRAMER: That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.

ELAINE: How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.

KRAMER: Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.

ELAINE: Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.



KRAMER: Now.



KRAMER: Where's that tool shed of yours?








ELAINE: Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.



ELAINE: I'll see you.








RALPH: You Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.

RALPH: What are the keys doing in there?

GEORGE: Just need to uh, to dig them up.

RALPH: You put them in there?

GEORGE: Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.

RALPH: Bad place to put your keys.

GEORGE: Yeah, I know that. Could you start, working?

RALPH: Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up.

GEORGE: Oh uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this about money?

RALPH: Yeah. It's about money.













MRSALLISTER: Excuse me, what are you doing in there?

ELAINE: Um, nothing. I was just um, I wasn't in there.

MRSALLISTER: You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you should of been downstairs in the basement cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood.

ELAINE: Right, because... I'm the janitor.

MRSALLISTER: Don't get smart with me.

ELAINE: Yes ma'am.















ELAINE: Oh, it's you.

JERRY: Is the flounder here yet?

ELAINE: No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?



ELAINE: There's this.

JERRY: Nice. French doors really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop bucket.



ELAINE: The fish!



ELAINE: Ah, what're you doing here?

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.



GEORGE: Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, so I thought I'd drop by.

JERRY: Kramer's guys?

GEORGE: Yeah. I got them down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jack hammering myself.

JERRY: Oh that's nice, kind of a hard labor fantasy camp.



GEORGE: Ow!

ELAINE: Uh, man!



KRAMER: Huh, yeah. Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, do you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.

ELAINE: I'm plumb out.

KRAMER: Oh dang, if I don't get that black paint off the city's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!



MRSALLISTER: Janitor?

ELAINE: Uh, Mrs. Allister. Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs. Allister. Okay, I've gotta get out.



ELAINE: Here, can you move from the door?



ELAINE: Hi, I um... what can I do for you?

MRSALLISTER: I told you yesterday to haul that trash out of the basement.

ELAINE: Yeah, I am so sorry.

MRSALLISTER: Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths.

ELAINE: Well, a lot of it is vegetables.



MRSALLISTER: Get that stuff out of there today or you'll be out of here. Understand?

ELAINE: Yes ma'am.



GEORGE: Stop pushing. Kramer spilled ammonia.

JERRY: I don't feel like eating.



KRAMER: I'm gonna borrow this, huh?

ELAINE: Janitor's meeting.






JENNA: So Jerry, why did you call me?

JERRY: Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. Did you?

JENNA: Yes, I did.

JERRY: Well, whatever. So, how've you been?

JENNA: Good.

JERRY: Good. Steak knife?

JENNA: Just eating away at you isn't it?

JERRY: No.



ELAINE: Hi.

JENNA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?

JERRY: For what?

ELAINE: I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.

JERRY: Dirt? That's alright, because there's nothing wrong with dirt.

ELAINE: Well, actually it's pretty grimy.

JERRY: Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.



ELAINE: Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.

JERRY: Sure. Bye.

ELAINE: Bye.

JENNA: Bye.

ELAINE: Bye.



JERRY: There, you see? I just leant her my car and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... 


JERRY: Alright! You win! That car was my last germ free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!

JENNA: Toilet brush.

JERRY: Toilet brush, oh.



JERRY: Alright, I can replace that.

JENNA: You wanna order dinner?

JERRY: Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I threw out all my dishes.
















JERRY: That's true.

JENNA: Mmm.

JERRY: But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of what could be a meaningful, long lasting relationship.











JENNA: Do you hear something?



JERRY: I don't know what that could be.















JERRY: Anyway, I'm a new man and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.







JERRY: Holy cow! Have a nice life.








ELAINE: Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Oh, yeah.








KRAMER: Bugger!






NEWMAN: You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.



NEWMAN: What the hell was that?








KRAMER: Double bugger!






NEWMAN: Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...



NEWMAN: Ah! Ah! Ah ah. Oh, oh the humanity! Ah!






KRAMER: Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?



KRAMER: Man, did you see that fireball? Woo hoo hoo, hoo hoo.



KRAMER: Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?



KRAMER: Newman! Newman!!



KRAMER: Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
