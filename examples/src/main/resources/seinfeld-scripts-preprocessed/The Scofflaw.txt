Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? "You need glasses", isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say, "Would you care for some glasses?" When people have crutches, they don't have like a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of them every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water skiing, the thing could just...








GARY: Hey George.

GEORGE: Gary? Well well well well. Where the hell have you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.

GARY: I know. I've been pretty busy.

GEORGE: Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. Alright, tell me, what's kept you so busy?

GARY: Mostly chemotherapy. Okay, I'll see you.





KRAMER: Hey pig!



SCOFFLAWCOP: Hey! Hey! Hey!






JERRY: So you called the cop a pig?

KRAMER: I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.

JERRY: Didn't you explain that to the cop?

KRAMER: No, I fled the scene.



JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey buddy.

GEORGE: Hey, uh...

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: Kramer, I, I, I uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.

KRAMER: Oh. What about?

GEORGE: Kramer.

KRAMER: Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?



GEORGE: Hey, you're hurting me!

KRAMER: You gonna share it with me next time, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, I swear!

KRAMER: Aw, alright, I'm looking forward to it.



GEORGE: Alright, I got news. You ready? Gary Fogel had cancer.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I knew.

GEORGE: You knew? How did you know?

JERRY: He told me a few months ago.

GEORGE: Why did he tell you and not me?

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: How are you closer to him than me?



GEORGE: So, is he okay?

JERRY: Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.

GEORGE: Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?

JERRY: No, he was on his regular bed.

GEORGE: So why didn't you tell me?

JERRY: He swore me to secrecy.

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: It's not like you're my wife.

GEORGE: Well, I still think you should of told me.

JERRY: Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.

GEORGE: Well, I wanna talk to him about this.

JERRY: That's right, you let him have it.

GEORGE: Uh huh.

JERRY: Who is he not to tell you about his life threatening illness?

GEORGE: That's what I'm saying.

JERRY: His illness is your business.

GEORGE: If not mine, whose?

JERRY: If not now, when?



ELAINE: Were you just talking about me?

GEORGE: No, an old friend of ours, Gary.

ELAINE: Oh, the guy with cancer?

GEORGE: You told her? She's not your wife!

JERRY: If I told you, you would have given it away.

GEORGE: You don't think I can keep a secret?

JERRY: No, but he would've read your face.

GEORGE: You don't trust my poker face?

JERRY: Do you ever win at poker?

GEORGE: No.



KRAMER: Hey. Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.

ELAINE: Uh, Jake Jarmel?

KRAMER: Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those?

ELAINE: Why? You don't wear glasses.

KRAMER: I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.

GEORGE: I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.

KRAMER: Yeah, I've considered that. Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?

ELAINE: Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.

KRAMER: Ah.

ELAINE: You know we had a really bad break up.

JERRY: The Jujyfruits?

ELAINE: Yeah, the Jujyfruits.






JAKE: Okay, K man, enjoy the book.

KRAMER: Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?

JAKE: I can't tell you that.

KRAMER: So you don't know where you got them?

JAKE: Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.

KRAMER: Well, that's peculiar.








GEORGE: Uh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.

GARY: Really?

GEORGE: Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.

GARY: Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.

GEORGE: Really? You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.

GARY: Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.

GEORGE: Well I still think it was wrong.

GARY: Right, well I'm sorry, alright. I guess I was just thinking of myself.

GEORGE: Well, obviously yes.






KRAMER: So I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.

SCOFFLAWCOP: Yeah? So why didn't you?

KRAMER: Scared of being shot.

SCOFFLAWCOP: Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my "white whale". Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!

KRAMER: I like that eye patch.




GEORGE: Alright, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.

GARY: Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner.

GEORGE: What, that's a Kinney lot?

GARY: Yeah, and there's a space opening up and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.

GEORGE: Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.

GARY: Alright, I got lunch alright?

GEORGE: You still owe me a secret.

GARY: Alright, listen. There is something I haven't told you, alright?

GEORGE: Yeah?

GARY: Yeah, but um, you can't tell Jerry.

GEORGE: What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.

GARY: Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.

GEORGE: Just one? I'm living like twenty. What's yours?

GARY: Well, I, I never actually had cancer.



GARY: I'll see you.






ELAINE: So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?

KRAMER: Flat out refused!

ELAINE: Yeah, isn't that just like him? You know, he has to be the only one who has them.

KRAMER: Yeah, tell me about it soul sister. Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.

ELAINE: What?



ELAINE: You told Jake I said hi?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! When did I say hi?

JERRY: I never heard her say hi.

KRAMER: Well, it's uh, common courtesy.

ELAINE: No, no. Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.

JERRY: It's like a game of tag.



JERRY: Where you going?

ELAINE: Nowhere.

JERRY: You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?

ELAINE: So what if I do?

KRAMER: Yeah, well listen. If you're going there, maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. Elaine!



JERRY: Hey. How'd it go with Gary?

GEORGE: Fine, fine.



JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: You look like something's on your mind.

GEORGE: No. Nothing. Fine.



JERRY: So, that's your poker face.

GEORGE: My regular face.

JERRY: No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.

GEORGE: What are you saying?

JERRY: Alright George, come on, what do you got?



GEORGE: I got nothing.

JERRY: What you got, a pair of bullets?

GEORGE: What you talking about?

JERRY: Two pair? Three of a kind?

GEORGE: Will you stop it?

JERRY: Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!

GEORGE: I don't have a flush.

JERRY: A full house? You got a full house? Turn them over George, I wanna see them. Come on, I'm calling!



JERRY: What do you got!

GEORGE: Gary Fogel never had cancer!








ELAINE: So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorized hi.

JAKE: You're saying you didn't say hi.

ELAINE: That's what I'm saying.

JAKE: So that's what you came down here to tell me?

ELAINE: Correct.

JAKE: You never said hi?

ELAINE: Correct.

JAKE: You still like me, don't you?

ELAINE: Correct. What's that?

MANINBOOKLINE: Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.



ELAINE: How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?

JAKE: Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you didn't say hi.

ELAINE: Ah, Jake... I, uh...




GEORGE: The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.

JERRY: So what was wrong with him?

GEORGE: Nothing!

JERRY: So he's been lying to me for two months?!

GEORGE: That's right.

JERRY: What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.

GEORGE: Well.

JERRY: I don't even think you could do it.

GEORGE: Oh, I could do it.

JERRY: Yeah, I guess you could.

GEORGE: Come on.

JERRY: Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?

GEORGE: You did that?

JERRY: Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.



GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything.



JERRY: Why not?

GEORGE: Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.

JERRY: So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.

GEORGE: Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.

JERRY: Why didn't he tell me?

GEORGE: Because you were being so nice.

JERRY: I don't think I can be that nice.

GEORGE: You be nice!








JERRY: Gary?

GARY: What do you think? Check it out.



JERRY: Is that from my gift certificate?

GARY: Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice.



JERRY: Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.

GARY: Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.

JERRY: I don't think so.

GARY: Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.



GEORGE: You be nice! He's giving me a parking space... parking space... parking space...



GARY: Well, what do you know. Hey, look there, you're loaded.

JERRY: Okay.

GARY: Hey, look who's over there. Miss cool toes. Check this out, Jack!





KRAMER: Hey buddy.

JERRY: Hey. Look at you. What, what's this?

KRAMER: It's an eye patch.

JERRY: You look like a pirate.

KRAMER: I wanna be a pirate.

JERRY: This is Gary.

KRAMER: How you doing?

GARY: Alright.



KRAMER: Well, I tell you there's only one problem.



JERRY: Can't see on your right side?

KRAMER: No. It's uh...



KRAMER: It's itchy




DEBBY: Nice car.

GEORGE: Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.

DEBBY: So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?

GEORGE: Oh well uh, Gary told me you said hi.

DEBBY: I didn't say hi.

GEORGE: You didn't?

DEBBY: Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.

GEORGE: Regards?

DEBBY: Yeah, regards.




ELAINE: Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?

ELAINESCABBIE: Smugness is not a good quality.

ELAINE: Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car.



ELAINE: Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.

ELAINESCABBIE: Good. Revenge is very good.






ELAINE: Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Sir?

GUYWITHGLASSES: Yes?

ELAINE: Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?

GUYWITHGLASSES: Malaysia.

ELAINE: Malaysia?

GUYWITHGLASSES: Yeah.

ELAINE: Um, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?

GUYWITHGLASSES: Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.

ELAINE: Oh!

GUYWITHGLASSES: But I, I can barely see without these.

ELAINE: Come on.

GUYWITHGLASSES: Well, these were expensive.

ELAINE: Let's start the bidding.




GEORGE: So, you didn't think this was a date?

DEBBY: No, not really. Why, is it... a date?

GEORGE: I thought it was a date.

DEBBY: No. It's not a date.

GEORGE: What about the regards?

DEBBY: Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... I shouldn't say anything.

GEORGE: No, tell me.

DEBBY: Can you keep a secret?

GEORGE: Me? Oh yeah.

DEBBY: I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, he was so brave and, and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I, I fell in love with him.

GEORGE: Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.






JERRY: Hey, do you know what the whip does?

KRAMER: What whip?

JERRY: The whip, in the Senate, in the House.

KRAMER: Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to they whipped them.



KRAMER: You better vote the way we want you to or there's gonna be big trouble.





GARY: She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!






SCOFFLAWCOP: Well, well. The "white whale".






GEORGE: Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.

DEBBY: Don't complain, at least you have your health.









DEBBY: George, look out for that man!











SCOFFLAWCOP: Hey! Hey, get back here!

KRAMER: Newman! The white whale!




GEORGE: Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?

JERRY: Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?

GEORGE: No. Definitely not.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

JERRY: And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.

GEORGE: The one who always sits by herself?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: How did he do that?

JERRY: Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.

GEORGE: Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!

JERRY: She thinks a guy who lies about a life threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?

GEORGE: He picked her up?

JERRY: Walked right over to her table.

GEORGE: Wow.








ELAINE: Jake, Jake. Take a look.



ELAINE: Aw, see, you're not the only one who has them. I have them too.

JAKE: Where did you get those?

ELAINE: Malaysia. I was in the area.








NEWMAN: Kramer.

KRAMER: Just drive.



KRAMER: Alright, now you listen and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.

NEWMAN: What're you talking about...

KRAMER: Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.

NEWMAN: Alright, so it's me. So what?

KRAMER: You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.

NEWMAN: I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!

KRAMER: Ah, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?

NEWMAN: I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.

KRAMER: So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?

NEWMAN: Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. Help me Kramer! Help me!

KRAMER: Alright, alright, I'm gonna help you.






GEORGE: I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.

JERRY: You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of them.

GEORGE: Well, some of them look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.

JERRY: What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?

GEORGE: The way they make them these days, I'll never have to tell her.

JERRY: So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out, "Here, Mrs. Costanza, I thought you might want this." Ah!






MRLIPPMAN: It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground then, you know, I think I'll have something for you.

ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Lippman. That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.

ELAINE: Oh really, you like them?

MRLIPPMAN: Uh huh. Very unusual.

ELAINE: Well, you know what?



MRLIPPMAN: What?

ELAINE: You can have them.

MRLIPPMAN: Oh, no no no. Please.

ELAINE: No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take them.

MRLIPPMAN: Really?

ELAINE: Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.

MRLIPPMAN: I could use a new pair of reading glasses.

ELAINE: They're from Malaysia.



MRLIPPMAN: Oh yeah?

ELAINE: Fabulous.






SCOFFLAWJUDGE: Well Mr. Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...



SCOFFLAWJUDGE: ...convenient to your home.

NEWMAN: I can't afford that!

SCOFFLAWJUDGE: Afford it you will, Mr. Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...



SCOFFLAWJUDGE: ...and sold at auction.

KRAMER: Well, don't you worry, your honor. He's in my custody.








GEORGE: Well, what do you think?

JERRY: I, really can't say.

GEORGE: No, say. I want you to say.

JERRY: It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look... stupid. I'm sorry.

TOUPEESALESMAN: You have to realize this has not been custom fitted to his scalp.

GEORGE: I really think this looks pretty good.

JERRY: Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?

GEORGE: Well, maybe you could show me something else.

TOUPEESALESMAN: As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.

JERRY: Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!

TOUPEESALESMAN: No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!

JERRY: Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!

TOUPEESALESMAN: All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist full of hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?!

JERRY: Alright! Take it easy! Take it easy.

GEORGE: Jerry!

JERRY: I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Please.



GARY: Hey Jerry, the...



GARY: George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!

GEORGE: Well I'm, I'm just looking.

GARY: Oh. Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.

TOUPEESALESMAN: I'll be right with you.



GARY: Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: What?

GARY: This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.



JERRY: You know, Gary.



JERRY: I had a little chat with George the other day...

GARY: You didn't!

GEORGE: I did.

JERRY: And he told me that that...



GARY: I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!

JERRY: Give me that thing!






GEORGE: How's your life? Alright?

WOMANINCAFE: Yeah, not bad at all.








MRLIPPMAN: And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel.





BOOKREPORTER: So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?



MRLIPPMAN: Oh, actually I uh, I have some very interesting information on that.



MRLIPPMAN: You know uh, this is a co-venture and as...

JAKE: Where did you get those?

MRLIPPMAN: ...as such, it...

JAKE: Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?

MRLIPPMAN: Where? What?

JAKE: Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. Give me those! I want the glasses! Give me those!



ELAINE: Excuse me. Have to go look for some socks.
