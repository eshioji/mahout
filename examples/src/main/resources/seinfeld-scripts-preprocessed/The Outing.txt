

JERRY: I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them, "You know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think it's about time, you know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doing this, "You know I think Joe might be a little..."



JERRY: They should vacuum. "You know I think Joe might be..."



JERRY: "Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little..."






ALLISON: I don't want to live! I don't want to live!

GEORGE: Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!

ALLISON: No... you're something.

GEORGE: You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!

ALLISON: You're good. You're good!

GEORGE: I'm bad. I'm bad!



ALLISON: You're killing me!




GEORGE: So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.

ELAINE: Over you?

GEORGE: Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?



JERRY: Yeah, I'm trying to get in touch with Sharon Leonard she works for the NYU paper, this is Jerry Seinfeld. She's supposed to meet me at a coffee shop to do an interview.



ELAINE: What are you going to get Jerry for his birthday?

GEORGE: I got him a great gift.

ELAINE: Really, what?

GEORGE: I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".

ELAINE: Oh, that is a good gift. Maybe he'll take me.

GEORGE: No, I'm going to go with him. What did you get him?

ELAINE: I got him a two line phone.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's good.



JERRY: Unbelievable! She's not there.

GEORGE: What paper does she write for?

JERRY: She works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.

ELAINE: Never even seen you? Gotta kind of envy that...

JERRY: You know, you've been developing quite the acid tongue lately.

ELAINE: Really?



ELAINE: Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?

JERRY: Living or all time?

ELAINE: All time.

JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

ELAINE: I donï¿½t know. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?

GEORGE: Lyndon Johnson was uglier than DeGaulle.

ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Mier could make them all run up a tree.

JERRY: Golda Mier?



ELAINE: Hey, come here.



ELAINE: Those two girls behind you, they're eavesdropping.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: You know uh, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.





GEORGE: So, what do you say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.

JERRY: What's the matter with you?

GEORGE: Come on, go along...

JERRY: I'm not going along. I can just see you in Berlin in nineteen thirty-nine goose stepping past me, "Come on Jerry, go along, go along..." You know I hear that all the time.

ELAINE: Hear what?

JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

ELAINE: Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.

JERRY: Yeah, because I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.



ELAINE: And you get along well with women.

GEORGE: I guess that leaves me in the clear.



SHARON: Hi Jerry it's Sharon from the NYU paper. I'm here at the coffee shop and I was a little late. I guess we must have missed each other.



JERRY: I'm going to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Me too.



SHARON: I'm going to be here a little while longer and I'll try to hook up with you later.








JERRY: Hi.

GEORGE: I just thought of a great name for myself if I ever become a porno actor.

JERRY: Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?

GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?

JERRY: You told me that already like two months ago.

GEORGE: Let me ask you something, what do you think of this shirt?

JERRY: Eh.

GEORGE: Allison bought it for me.

JERRY: How you gonna get out of that one?

GEORGE: I don't know. I guess I have to wait for her to die.



JERRY: Yeah?



SHARON: Sharon from NYU.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: Who was that?

JERRY: Oh, that's that reporter from NYU. She's finally going to do the interview. I told her to come up here so this way we wouldn't miss each other.

GEORGE: Do you want me to stay?

JERRY: Sure, I don't care.





JERRY: Hi.



SHARON: Hi, I'm, I'm Sharon.

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. Something the matter?

SHARON: No no no, nothing.

JERRY: You look familiar, have we ever met?

SHARON: I'm not sure, have we?

JERRY: You look familiar. Uh, why don't we do this over here.



JERRY: This is George.

SHARON: Oh hi, nice to meet you.



JERRY: He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?

SHARON: Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.

JERRY: Oh. Okay.



GEORGE: Uh oh.

SHARON: Oh, is that a problem?

GEORGE: I, I just hate my, my voice on tape. It always sounds so high and whiny.



SHARON: Shall we start?

JERRY: Fire away.

SHARON: Okay, let's see, um, are you just a comedian or do you do anything else?

JERRY: George and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

SHARON: Oh, so you also work together?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Jerry did you wash this pear?

JERRY: Yeah, I washed it.

GEORGE: It looks like it hasn't been washed.

JERRY: So wash it.

GEORGE: You hear the way he talks to me?



SHARON: You should hear how my boyfriend talks to me.



JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Hey uh, let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?

SHARON: It's nice.

GEORGE: Jerry said he didn't like it.

JERRY: I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was okay.

GEORGE: No, you said you didn't like it.

JERRY: Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world or something?

SHARON: So how did you two meet?



JERRY: Oh, actually we met in the um, gym locker room.

GEORGE: Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. And uh, I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and I fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.



SHARON: Do you guys live together?

JERRY: Live together?

GEORGE: No, I got my own place.



SHARON: Oh, and do your parents know?

JERRY: Know what?

GEORGE: My parents? They don't know what's going on.



JERRY: Oh God! You're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us! I knew you looked familiar!



GEORGE: Oh no! No!



SHARON: I better get going.



JERRY: There's been a big misunderstanding here!

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah!

JERRY: We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean its fine if that's who you are.

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: I mean I have many gay friends.

GEORGE: My father is gay.

SHARON: Look, I know, I know what I heard.

JERRY: Heard, it was a joke.

GEORGE: Look, you wanna have sex right now!? Do want to have sex with me right now!? Let's go!



GEORGE: Come on, let's go baby! Come on!



KRAMER: Hey, Come on! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: No steam! No steam!

KRAMER: Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!




JERRY: The whole thing is your fault.

ELAINE: You want me to talk to her? I'd be perfectly willing to talk to her.

JERRY: I don't think so.

ELAINE: Walk into a room, problem solved.

JERRY: She said she's going to think about it.

ELAINE: Eh, so what if it does come out. It will just be in an NYU paper.

JERRY: Why don't you take your jacket off.

ELAINE: Nah, I'm okay.

JERRY: I'm going to try her again.



KRAMER: Happy birthday paruba!

JERRY: Today's not my birthday.

KRAMER: Well, I beg to differ.

JERRY: Well I think I know when my birthday is.

KRAMER: Yeah well you'd think so but you'd be wrong.



JERRY: Maybe he's right, maybe it is my birthday. Would you take the jacket off.

ELAINE: Leave me alone! Get off my back about the jacket.



JERRY: Oh, look at this! A phone! A two line phone!



JERRY: That's terrific! Now when someone is talking on the phone I can still make a call. Look Elaine, a two line phone!

ELAINE: Yeah I see it.



KRAMER: I'm going to get one myself.

JERRY: Where you going?

ELAINE: I gotta go return something.





JERRY: I got a dial tone. Okay, this is the maiden call.

KRAMER: Oh wait, wait. I want to get the first call alright?

JERRY: Alright go to your house I'll call you.





KRAMER: Hello.

JERRY: Hello? Hey, it's working. This is great, thanks a lot.

KRAMER: Happy birthday buddy.



JERRY: Oh wait, I got a call on the other line.

KRAMER: Okay, later.

JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.



JERRY: Hello?

SHARON: Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.

JERRY: Oh, hi.

SHARON: I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.

JERRY: Thank you very much, that's great.



JERRY: Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line.



JERRY: Hello?

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, how you doing? You know I got that uh, reporter from the newspaper on the other line.

GEORGE: So what did she say?

JERRY: Oh, she said she's not going to play up that, that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. I guess we fooled her. Alright I'll get rid of her, hold on.



JERRY: Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there?



JERRY: I'm back.

GEORGE: You know... I could hear you on the other line.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: I heard what you said, "Sharon, are you there?"

JERRY: You heard me talking on the other line, are you sure?

GEORGE: Yes, I heard you!

JERRY: Well maybe she was disconnected.

GEORGE: Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!

JERRY: Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on.



KRAMER: Hello?

JERRY: Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on.



GEORGE: "There may be a problem with the phone, hold on!"

JERRY: Oh no!



JERRY: Kramer this phone's a piece of junk goodbye!

GEORGE: "This phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!"

JERRY: Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?

GEORGE: Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it.

JERRY: No no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!




ELAINE: Hi.

SHARON: Hi, Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah, nice to meet you.

SHARON: Thanks for meeting with me.

ELAINE: Sure.

SHARON: Ah, would you like to take a seat?

ELAINE: Sure, thank you.

SHARON: Why don't you uh, take your coat off?






ELAINE: So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.

JERRY: She didn't take her coat off at my house, either.

GEORGE: You know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house the families go to war!

ELAINE: Give me a break.

JERRY: So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: Not at all.



JERRY: Take that coat off!

ELAINE: No, I'm not going to!



GEORGE: Anyway, when are we going to see her. I'd like to read the article.

JERRY: They're sending it to me.

GEORGE: Well, here you go, happy birthday.



JERRY: Thank you.

GEORGE: Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!

JERRY: "Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?

GEORGE: It's "Guys And Dolls", not "Guys And Guys".

JERRY: You're right, it's "Guys and Dolls", thanks, thank you very much.

ELAINE: Alright, well, happy birthday.



JERRY: Oh Lainey!



JERRY: "The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".

ELAINE: I thought you liked that king of music.

JERRY: Oh, she's alright.

ELAINE: You said you liked her.

JERRY: Well, so what, maybe I do like her, so what!

ELAINE: So nothing.

JERRY: Well thanks for the CD's.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, your welcome.



ELAINE: Why are those two people pointing at you over there?

JERRY: I don't know.



JERRY: What do you got there?

MANONEATCAFE: The New York Post, they've got an article about you.

JERRY: "Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long time companion seem to be inseparable." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!

GEORGE: Now everyone's going to think we're gay!



JERRY: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

GEORGE: No, not at all.




JERRY: "Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor pad, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of fruit like an old married couple." I told you that pear was washed!





KRAMER: I thought we were friends.

JERRY: Here we go.

KRAMER: I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?

JERRY: It's not true!

KRAMER: Ah! Enough lying! The lying is through! Now come on Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...

JERRY: So are you.

KRAMER: Yeah.



GEORGE: Hello?

HELEN: George?

GEORGE: Mrs. Seinfeld?!

HELEN: Oh my God.

JERRY: Oh my God!



JERRY: Ma?

HELEN: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma!

GEORGE: Oh my God! My mother!!!



HELEN: Jerry?

JERRY: Ma, it's not true!

MORTY: It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!

HELEN: They weren't culottes, they were shorts.

MORTY: They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.

HELEN: By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!

MORTY: It looked like he was wearing a skirt for crying out loud!

JERRY: Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!

HELEN: Not that there's anything wrong with that Jerry.




ESTELLE: I open up the paper and this is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move. The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!

GEORGE: It's not true!

ESTELLE: Every day it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows what you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.

GEORGE: Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.

ESTELLE: Who, Buck Naked? Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.

GEORGE: Of course not.



MALENURSE: Six thirty Scott. Time for your sponge bath.



SCOTT: Six thirty all ready? I fell asleep.

MALENURSE: Let me help you off with that. Here, I'll just slip it over your head.



MALENURSE: The water is nice and warm, isn't it.

SCOTT: Oh, that feels real good.

ESTELLE: George, are you telling me the truth?



ESTELLE: George, I'm talking to you!




JERRY: Hey, you'll never guess who left a message on my machine? That reporter from NYU. I wonder what she wants.

GEORGE: Alright, the play is tomorrow night. Would you like to have dinner first or meet at the theatre?



SERVICEMAN: Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.



JERRY: You know what? I think I'll pass on the Guys and Dolls.

GEORGE: Alright, fine, don't go. I try and go out and do something special for your birthday and this is the thanks I get! Everything's tainted now.

JERRY: Would you keep your voice down!

GEORGE: No, I will not keep my voice down!! Nothing can make me keep my voice down!!





MONKSMANAGER: If you boys cannot control yourselves then I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.



GEORGE: Fine, I'll take Elaine.

ELAINE: Yes.

GEORGE: Just don't say anything to Alice.

ELAINE: No I won't. Did she see the article?

GEORGE: No. Just imagine her reaction.

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh my God.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think... I'm out baby!! I'm out!!






ALLISON: Yeah? So?

GEORGE: Yeah so?

ALLISON: Well this is nice. They mention your name.

GEORGE: Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?

ALLISON: No, what?

GEORGE: I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.

ALLISON: You're gay?

GEORGE: Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.

ALLISON: I don't believe it.

GEORGE: You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.

ALLISON: I will.

GEORGE: What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.



ALLISON: I want to hear it from Jerry.




SHARON: Oh, can you ever forgive me?

JERRY: I don't know.



JERRY: Alright, I forgive you.

SHARON: You know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.

JERRY: I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.





GEORGE: Jerry! Oh my God! What are you doing!?!

JERRY: What!?

GEORGE: You're with a woman!

JERRY: I know! What are you doing here?!?

GEORGE: I leave you alone for two seconds and this is what you do! I trusted you!



JERRY: Would you get the hell out of here!

SHARON: What's, what's going on?

ALLISON: Yeah, what's going on?

GEORGE: Alright, tell her. Go ahead.

JERRY: Tell her what?

GEORGE: You know. About us.



JERRY: Are you crazy!

GEORGE: Tell her Jerry, tell her.



JERRY: I'm not telling her nothing.



SHARON: This is to weird.

GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, youï¿½re the girl who wrote the article. Go ahead, tell her.

SHARON: I'm out of here.



JERRY: It's not true! It's not true! Not that there's anything wrong with that! You stupid idiot!



GEORGE: Please don't be upset.



JERRY: Oh will you stop it with that stuff!

ALLISON: What is going on!

GEORGE: Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.



ALLISON: Really?

GEORGE: Oh my God.



JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey.

KRAMERSFRIEND: Hello.



GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

KRAMER: Alright, we'll see you later.





KRAMER: He's the phone man!







KRAMER: Not that there's anything wrong with that.
