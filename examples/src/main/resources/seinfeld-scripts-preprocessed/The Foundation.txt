

GEORGE: Well... it's a magnificent stone.

MRROSS: They put it up this morning.



GEORGE: It's just a magnificent stone. Jerry?



MRSROSS: George, we'll leave you alone with her.

GEORGE: What?

MRSROSS: I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.



GEORGE: No, I, I, I, I'm good. Really.



GEORGE: Jerry?



JERRY: Thank you, no.



GEORGE: And then, right after the All Star break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore.



GEORGE: So... yeah.




GEORGE: Boy, that was awkward!

JERRY: I don't mind the cemetery.

GEORGE: What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?

JERRY: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.

GEORGE: What is that?

JERRY: Star Trek Two.

GEORGE: Wrath of Khan!

JERRY: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.

GEORGE: That was a hell of a thing when Spock died.

JERRY: Yeah.



GEORGE: Well anyway, the uh, the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.

JERRY: So it's over?

GEORGE: I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.

JERRY: Alright, so uh, let's do something later. How about a movie?

GEORGE: Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!



KRAMER: Movie?

JERRY: Yeah, you in?

KRAMER: No no no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.

GEORGE: George is going to the movies!



JERRY: So how's your karate class going?

KRAMER: Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.

JERRY: But with punching and kicking.

KRAMER: Jerry, karate is not here.



KRAMER: Its here.



KRAMER: And here.



KRAMER: And here.



JERRY: Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.

KRAMER: What, she's been away?

JERRY: She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

KRAMER: No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.

JERRY: That was July fourth!



JERRY: Alright, I'm out of here and when I get back, I don't want to see you here.



JERRY: Here.



JERRY: Or here.






ELAINE: It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.

JERRY: Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?

ELAINE: Oh, tons!

JERRY: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?

ELAINE: You don't respect my work at all, do you?

JERRY: No, I don't.

ELAINE: So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiance?

JERRY: My what?

ELAINE: Jeannie, your fiancee.

JERRY: Oh yeah, that. Well...

ELAINE: Alright. Spill it, Jerome.

JERRY: There's really not that much to tell.



JERRY: About a month ago we were here having lunch when all of a sudden we both just blurted out...



JERRY: I hate you!

JEANNIE: I hate you!



JEANNIE: See you.

JERRY: See you.



JERRY: It was unprecedented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup in relationship history.



JERRY: No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

ELAINE: You've never felt remorse.

JERRY: I know, I feel bad about that.

ELAINE: I bet your parents were upset, huh?

JERRY: Eh.

ELAINE: You haven't told them yet, have you?

JERRY: No.




DUGAN: "So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria..."

PETERMAN: Oh for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is.

DUGAN: It's a, uh, washcloth.

PETERMAN: No washcloths!

ELAINE: Well Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.



PETERMAN: Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.

ELAINE: Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

PETERMAN: Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.

ELAINE: Well, see its businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the uh, the Urban Sombrero.



ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?




GEORGE: I tell you Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.

JERRY: Pride?

GEORGE: No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.

JERRY: Well, you're your own boss now.

GEORGE: I wanna go to a tractor pull.

JERRY: Go ahead.

GEORGE: I am staying out all night!

JERRY: Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.

JERRY: Whatever.



JERRY: Oh God.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: It's Dolores.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: Mulva.



DOLORES: Jerry, hi.

JERRY: Hi Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?

GEORGE: Dolores!

DOLORES: Hi. I heard you got engaged.

JERRY: Yes Dolores, I did. It didn't work out though, Dolores.

DOLORES: Oh, that's too bad. You know we should get together sometime. See you.

JERRY: See you.

GEORGE: Bye, Dolores.



GEORGE: I thought Mulva hated you.

JERRY: Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.

GEORGE: All the way?

JERRY: Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.

GEORGE: Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.

JERRY: You stink worse than I do!

GEORGE: I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!






ELAINE: Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?

PETERMAN: Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.

ELAINE: What? Well, who's gonna do it?

PETERMAN: What about you?

ELAINE: Me? Why me?

PETERMAN: Why, indeed.

ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

PETERMAN: I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.

ELAINE: Burma?

PETERMAN: You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons!





ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?




JERRY: Where?

ELAINE: Burma.

JERRY: Isn't it Myanmar now?

ELAINE: Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!

JERRY: No, certainly not.

ELAINE: I mean, I can't give people orders!

JERRY: No one's gonna listen to you.

ELAINE: I am not qualified to run the catalog!

JERRY: You're not qualified to work at the catalog.



KRAMER: Hey. What's wrong?

ELAINE: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.

KRAMER: Where?

JERRY: Myanmar.

KRAMER: The discount pharmacy?

ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.

KRAMER: Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult?



KRAMER: What, you don't have enough experience?



KRAMER: Oh, you're not smart enough?



KRAMER: Where's your confidence?



KRAMER: Look Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...

ELAINE: Karate?

KRAMER: Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside and I found my katra.

ELAINE: Katra?

KRAMER: Yeah, your spirit, your uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"

JERRY: Sammy Davis had it.

KRAMER: So I listened to my katra and now I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.

ELAINE: Well you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.

KRAMER: Sure you have.

ELAINE: I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.

KRAMER: You follow your katra and you can do anything.



KRAMER: Now get out of here.

ELAINE: Okay.



KRAMER: That kid is gonna be alright.

JERRY: No, she's not.



LITTLEJOEY: Come on, Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey there.

LITTLEJOEY: Come on. Mom's down in the car.

KRAMER: Okay Joey.



JERRY: You guys both have class at the same time?

KRAMER: No, we're in the same class.

JERRY: What do you mean you're in the same class?

KRAMER: He almost beat me.

JERRY: Kramer, you're fighting children?!

KRAMER: We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.

JERRY: He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!



KRAMER: I got carpool.






KRAMER: Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

LITTLEJOEY: Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?

MRSZANFINO: Mmm, I don't know...



MRSZANFINO: Alright.



KRAMER: Yay!




DUGAN: You're taking the job?

ELAINE: You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by six. No, make that six ideas by four. Alright, let's move, move, move, move, move!






SANSEI: Are you prepared for kumite?

KRAMER: Yes, Sansei

LITTLEJOEY: Yes, Sansei.

SANSEI: Fight stance.



SANSEI: Hydjama! Begin!



SANSEI: Winner!






GEORGE: It's open!



GEORGE: Rosses.

MRSROSS: Hello, George.

GEORGE: Well uh, come in, come, come in.



MRROSS: We uh, tried to call but the line was busy.

GEORGE: Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese there?



MRSROSS: We know the last three months have been hard on you.

GEORGE: Oh yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

MRROSS: And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.

GEORGE: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.

MRROSS: That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.

GEORGE: Oh, that's wonderful.

MRROSS: And of course, we want you to be an integral part.

GEORGE: Yes, how, how integral?

MRROSS: You'll be on the board of directors.

GEORGE: Great, great. Oh, oh, oh gosh. You know, it's just my duties with the Yankees.

MRSROSS: Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.

GEORGE: I can't believe this is happening.

MRROSS: Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, what was it, dear?

MRSROSS: Something about a way and a light uh, ha. Who the hell knows?

MRROSS: Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.

MRSROSS: So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?

GEORGE: The second I see him.




JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey. How's your day, good?

JERRY: Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.

GEORGE: So uh, Wrath of Khan, huh?

JERRY: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?

GEORGE: What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?

JERRY: No no no, it's, "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."

GEORGE: That's it. That's the line...



GEORGE: ...that destroyed my life.



JERRY: Problem?

GEORGE: The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry. And I have to sit on the board of directors.

JERRY: Hey, board of directors. Look at you!

GEORGE: Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!

JERRY: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.

GEORGE: Don't you see? I'm back in.

JERRY: All because of Wrath of Khan?

GEORGE: Yes!

JERRY: Well, it was the best of those movies.



GEORGE: Khan!!!




WYCK: George.



WYCK: George.



GEORGE: Oh!

WYCK: I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.

GEORGE: Wink.

WYCK: Wyck.

GEORGE: Wyck.

WYCK: Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.

GEORGE: Oh. I know they have some monies.

WYCK: They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.

GEORGE: So, if Susan and I had, I mean, if the envelopes hadn't uh, then we...

WYCK: Yes.

GEORGE: And now?

WYCK: Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.

GEORGE: This townhouse?

WYCK: This would have been your wedding gift.

GEORGE: And now?

WYCK: Not.

GEORGE: Not.

WYCK: Also endowed. George, I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.

GEORGE: You know, it really can't.




DOLORES: So who broke it off?

JERRY: Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.

DOLORES: Oh come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.

JERRY: I am. It was the world's first.

DOLORES: You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought maybe you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here.



JERRY: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains I was completely... Mulva!




JERRY: Hello?



JERRY: Oh, I don't believe this.

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: Hey!

ELAINE: Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog?

JERRY: How's it look?

ELAINE: It's a peach.

JERRY: Huh?

ELAINE: I say it's a peach.

JERRY: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?

ELAINE: No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it and you shouldn't be selling it.

JERRY: I gotta do some research here.

ELAINE: Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. You did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. You are the doofus.

JERRY: Oh, I'm the doofus?

ELAINE: Yeah. You Jerry, are the doofus.

JERRY: You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.

ELAINE: Oh well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.

JERRY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.




ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: Oh hey.

ELAINE: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Oh, well I, I, I'm dominating.

ELAINE: You never said you were fighting children.

KRAMER: Well, it's not the size of the opponent Elaine, it's uh, the ferocity.

ELAINE: This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?

KRAMER: No no, that's from uh, Star Trek three, The Search for Spock.

ELAINE: Search for Spock?!

KRAMER: Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...



ELAINE: You doofus!






JERRY: Okay, question number eight. What if I told you my fiance left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.

WAITRESSONE: More.

WAITRESSTWO: Less.

RUTHIE: Same.

WILLIE: Are we about through here?







KRAMER: I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.

LITTLEJOEY: She had a little change of plans.



KRAMER: What's going on? Hey Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?

GIRL: Now we finish it.



KRAMER: Ah! Ah! Mama!




JERRY: Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.



JERRY: Uh look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye.





JERRY: So, did you stop by the dojo?

ELAINE: Yep.

JERRY: How's your confidence level?

ELAINE: Shot.

JERRY: Self esteem?

ELAINE: Gone.

JERRY: Doofus?



ELAINE: Yo.

JERRY: Alright, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?



JERRY: What is that?

ELAINE: It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.

JERRY: Well, nobody sees the cover.



KRAMER: God!

JERRY: What happened to you?

KRAMER: Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh.



KRAMER: What is that?

JERRY: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.

KRAMER: Oh I see.



KRAMER: Woof!



ELAINE: You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!

KRAMER: Well, then I was way off!

ELAINE: Well, I'll see you.



JERRY: Vaya con dios.

KRAMER: Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?

JERRY: No, he's still stuck at the foundation.

KRAMER: You know, you ought to go down there and help him out. He's a widower.

JERRY: Widower? Wait a second.






WYCK: Okay, let's see. The beach house. Forty-eight acres, oh, Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.

GEORGE: Would I have had access to that?

WYCK: Of course, it would have been yours.

GEORGE: And now?



GEORGE: Not.



GEORGE: Hello?

JERRY: Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.

GEORGE: My story?

JERRY: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof.



JERRY: When are you getting out of there?

GEORGE: Uh excuse me, Wyck? Uh, are we uh, almost done here?

WYCK: Oh no, not even close.

GEORGE: I can't go.

JERRY: What do you mean you can't go? There's two girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!



WYCK: Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value, two point six million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
