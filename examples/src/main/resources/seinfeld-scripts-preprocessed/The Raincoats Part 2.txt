JERRY: Here's what happened last week in case you missed it.






JERRY: I, I, I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is, "Nasty wear." Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, yeah well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. We don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go...



JERRY: ...and it's just gone.











JERRY: Hey.

MORTY: Hey, Jerry.

HELEN: So how was the movie?

JERRY: Oh, really good, really good.

HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that.



JERRY: Like that.



MORTY: What about the end, with the list?

JERRY: Yeah, that was some list.

HELEN: What did you think about the black and white?

JERRY: The black and white.

MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I didn't even realize.

MORTY: You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah, I tell you, I could see it again.




KRAMER: So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it.



KRAMER: Just get it in there.



RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.

KRAMER: Yeah, hey I'm on your side.



KRAMER: Hey what again?

GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.

KRAMER: Paella, yeah I'll be there.

GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfeld's are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh, your partner.

KRAMER: No no, you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.

GEORGE: Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.

KRAMER: Yeah I know.

GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work.

KRAMER: That's right.

GEORGE: He's ripping you off.

KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off.

GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you.

KRAMER: He's ripping me off!

GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.

KRAMER: Yeah!





RUDY: Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.






MORTY: You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?

HELEN: Well he told you about the place.

MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finder's fee. You know what a finder's fee is?

HELEN: You find something you get a fee.

MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.

HELEN: Well it's too late now.

MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.

HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.



KRAMER: I've been thinking about something.

MORTY: Yeah, so have I.

KRAMER: Ah! I don't think the deal is fair.

MORTY: You don't think it's fair?

KRAMER: No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.

MORTY: What leg work?

KRAMER: Oh, there's leg work.

MORTY: If anything you're getting too much.

KRAMER: Too much?!

MORTY: That's right, they're my coats.

KRAMER: Look I want thirty-five percent.

MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen.

KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen.

MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five.

KRAMER: Alright, let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.

MORTY: Okay, it's a deal.






RUDY: Moths are the scourge of my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.

GEORGE: I'm sorry, um, here's your money back.



GEORGE: I'll have the clothes.



RUDY: It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.

GEORGE: So uh, where are the clothes?

RUDY: I burned them.

GEORGE: Oh. That's good.






ELAINE: I know they're your parents Jerry and they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?

JERRY: It is a tad askew.

ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?

JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.

ELAINE: See, see, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but, but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.

JERRY: You're right, he's insane.

ELAINE: Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.

JERRY: So what are you going to do?

ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh God. So how was the movie?

JERRY: Uh, from what I saw it was pretty good.

ELAINE: Yeah? What do you mean from what you saw?

JERRY: Well I um, I didn't ah, actually get to see the whole movie.

ELAINE: Yeah, why not?

JERRY: I was kind of um, making out.

ELAINE: You were making out during Schindler's List?

JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.

ELAINE: During Schindler's List?

JERRY: We're both living with our parents.

ELAINE: Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?

JERRY: No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but he didn't see me.

ELAINE: Oh.






NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld

HELEN: Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here.



NEWMAN: Uh, ah.



NEWMAN: Having a nice trip?



HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.

NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.

HELEN: Wondering what?

NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry?

HELEN: Well, we already saw it.

NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.



MORTY: Why is that?

NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.

HELEN: I'm afraid I don't.

NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.

MORTY: What?

NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for you? He was moving on her like the storm troopers into Poland.

HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?

NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.

HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out.

NEWMAN: Oh, right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Ta ta.










JERRY: Hi.



JERRY: What? What did I do?

HELEN: How could you?

JERRY: How could I what?

HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?

JERRY: What? No.

MORTY: Don't lie Jerry.

JERRY: Newman.

HELEN: How could you do such a thing?

JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kind of started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.



JERRY: Hello?



JACK: Hello Jerry, its Jack Klompus.

JERRY: Hang on a second. Dad it's Klompus.

MORTY: Hello?

JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.

MORTY: You didn't get in?

JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.

MORTY: You broke the window?

HELEN: He broke the window?

JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?

DORIS: He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.

MORTY: Did you send them?

JACK: Yeah, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.

MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon?

HELEN: Tomorrow afternoon?

JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon?

MORTY: I told you to send them express.

JACK: Well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning. I figured what the hell's the difference?

MORTY: So what did you do about the window?

JACK: I gotta fix your window now?

MORTY: Alright, alright, goodbye.



MORTY: I don't think we are gonna make that flight.

JERRY: What do you mean you're not making the flight?

HELEN: We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.

MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.



HELEN: Some place else? What about Paris?

MORTY: You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.

HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.

MORTY: You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.

HELEN: I think you're out of your mind.




FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.

GEORGE: Moths?

FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes?

GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they, they're everywhere.

ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfeld's anyway. He's an idiot all together.



ESTELLE: Ah, there's Kramer.



KRAMER: Hello?

ESTELLE: Hello.

KRAMER: Hello.



KRAMER: Hey.



KRAMER: Ha ha, good evening.



ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry.



KRAMER: Oh Paella.

GEORGE: Hey uh, let me take you're coat.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, thanks buddy.

FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?

KRAMER: What?

FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes?



FRANK: Give me that back!

KRAMER: Whoa.

GEORGE: Dad?!



KRAMER: I bought it from Rudy.

GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.

FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes?

GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday.

FRANK: You sold my clothes?



FRANK: What do you mean you sold my clothes?

GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore.

FRANK: It's cruise wear!

ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

FRANK: That's because it's mine!

ESTELLE: You look just like Frank on our honeymoon.

KRAMER: Oh, well thank you.



FRANK: Who's this Rudy?

KRAMER: Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.

FRANK: Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.

KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.

GEORGE: Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?

KRAMER: Yeah.

GEORGE: What happens to charter tickets when you don't use them?

KRAMER: Well I suppose they are wasted.

GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are.

FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.

KRAMER: A mouse!








JERRY: You want the tickets?

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

GEORGE: Hey, I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall of Fame, I mail my own postcards.

JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets.

GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.






KRAMER: Oh, you should have gone to the Costanza's for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?

MORTY: Not really.

KRAMER: Oh it's an orgiastic feast for the senses. It's like a festival, the sites, sounds, and colors and mmm.

JERRY: Hey Dad, are you sure we are at the right carousel?

MORTY: This is it.

KRAMER: So how much are we gonna make?

MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.

KRAMER: What, two thousand? Three thousand?

MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.

KRAMER: More? More than three thousand?

MORTY: Just watch me do my thing.



JERRY: Say Dad, isn't that one of yours?

MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps.



MORTY: Kramer you missed a couple.

PARISTICKETAGENT: Bonjour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.

JERRY: Dad isn't that your charter group?



GEORGE: Honesty, hard work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.

JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.






FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.

RUDY: Who are you anyways?

FRANK: I'm the father.

RUDY: He said his father was dead.

FRANK: He said I was dead?

RUDY: That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.

FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars?



KRAMER: Hey, Frank!

FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.

MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.

FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered.

MORTY: I retract your retraction.

FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?

MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.

RUDY: You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.

KRAMER: I thought we had a deal?

FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!!

RUDY: I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.

MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.

RUDY: Yeah, how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?

FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!

MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?

RUDY: That's right.



KRAMER: I'm all ticklish.










MORTY: Okay, let's go.

HELEN: It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.

AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: No.

MORTY: Ah, good bye.



ELAINE: Good bye.

JERRY: Take care.

MORTY: Alright Jer.



ELAINE: Nice to see.

MORTY: Bye bye Elaine.

JERRY: Bye bye.

HELEN: Bye bye.



HELEN: We'll call you when we get home.

AARON: Thank you.

JERRY: I think she meant me, but.

MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.

JERRY: Okay.



ELAINE: Bye.

JERRY: Bye.



ELAINE: Aaron? Aaron are you okay?

AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more.

ELAINE: You did enough.

AARON: No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I could of got them out.

JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.



AARON: This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip.



AARON: This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. 


AARON: Water, they need some water.



ELAINE: Why?

AARON: They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfeld's some water. Please! Please!








JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein, is Rachel home?

MRGOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight or any other night for that matter.

JERRY: Why, what did I do?



MRGOLDSTEIN: You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself. I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building.



MRGOLDSTEIN: Now if you don't mind.



JERRY: Rachel!

MRGOLDSTEIN: Good night!

JERRY: Rachel!






JERRY: So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.

ELAINE: Ah!



ELAINE: Get Out! How did it happen?

JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.

ELAINE: Oh boy. They could use a vacation.

JERRY: Yeah, they're taking one. The travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.

ELAINE: So how about that Aaron?

JERRY: Whew.

ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?

JERRY: No, I hadn't noticed.



NEWMAN: Pair of bearclaws please.



JERRY: Hi Newman.



NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.

NEWMAN: Oh, were you there?

JERRY: Yes I was.

NEWMAN: It's a, it's a... powerful film.

JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?

NEWMAN: Shocking.

JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.



NEWMAN: Jerry! Jerry!








GEORGE: Where the hell is your father?!








ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did.

FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.

ESTELLE: Ah forget about them, let's just...






JERRY: Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is urinals, you want some distance there too. ATM's and urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuables out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.
