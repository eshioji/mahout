

GEORGE: Maura, I uh, I want you to know, I, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but we uh, we have to break up.

MAURA: No.



GEORGE: What's that?

MAURA: We're not breaking up.



GEORGE: We're not?

MAURA: No.





GEORGE: Alright.






JERRY: She said no?

GEORGE: She said no.

JERRY: What did you do?

GEORGE: What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!

JERRY: George, both parties don't have to consent to a break up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.

GEORGE: Well, I don't really like her.

JERRY: That's good.

GEORGE: I don't find her attractive.

JERRY: Solid.

GEORGE: I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women.

JERRY: Always popular.

GEORGE: Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food, "Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are so good."

JERRY: You have an airtight case!

GEORGE: And in bed...

JERRY: I'm afraid we're out of time.



JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got them at an auction.

GEORGE: I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.

JERRY: No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm going to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.

GEORGE: You already have an in. You have the same first name! "Jerry"!

JERRY: Oh, that'll intrigue him.

GEORGE: Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.

JERRY: George Peppard has been dead for years.

GEORGE: Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!




GLENN: So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?

ELAINE: Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something hot and spicy, you know? Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta, you know? Painless, don't want anything too heavy.

GLENN: So um, why don't we get together some time?

ELAINE: Oh sure! Why don't you give me your number?

GLENN: I think it'd be better if I called you.

ELAINE: Oh. Okay. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. Do you work around here or...

GLENN: Mmm no, not really.

ELAINE: So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?

GLENN: I think you're very beautiful.

ELAINE: Oh.



ELAINE: That'll do!






JERRY: What about Puddy?

ELAINE: I haven't talked to him in like, three weeks. I think it might be over.

JERRY: So, what's this guy about?

ELAINE: I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked. I'll bet he's in a relationship.

JERRY: Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!

ELAINE: Which one is he?

JERRY: Green suit, power ring.

ELAINE: I don't care for jewelry on men.



KRAMER: Hey. It happened again.



KRAMER: Another robbery in the building.

JERRY: So you bought a cooler?

KRAMER: No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.

ELAINE: And what would those be?

KRAMER: Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my military discharge.

JERRY: You were in the Army?

KRAMER: Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions.

ELAINE: Literally.

KRAMER: "Literally"? What's that supposed to mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?

JERRY: No, go ahead.



KRAMER: A little privacy, huh?

JERRY: Oh, come on!

ELAINE: Oh!

KRAMER: Come on Jerry, this is a security issue! Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army.

JERRY: How long did you last?

KRAMER: Well, that's classified.



ELAINE: Hey, what if he's married?

JERRY: Kramer?!

ELAINE: No, the Green Lantern.

KRAMER: Okay!



JERRY: So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.

ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.



KRAMER: You peeked!

JERRY: This is your hiding place?!



KRAMER: It was under a spoon!






GEORGE: And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up.



GEORGE: Thank you and good night.





MAURA: No George, we're not.

GEORGE: But I proved it!

MAURA: I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.

GEORGE: Well then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.

MAURA: I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.

GEORGE: Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!




ELAINE: So, how is a guy like you not involved?

GLENN: I might ask you the same thing.

ELAINE: That's true, maybe he's not married.





ELAINE: Oh, that is so sweet. How long do I have to hold this?



GLENN: Oh no.

ELAINE: Who is it?

GLENN: Um, uh, no one, no one.



GLENN: Here uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.

ELAINE: Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower.




ELAINE: Jerry! Jerry!



JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing down there?

ELAINE: You didn't hear me buzzing?

JERRY: Oh, I guess it's broken!

ELAINE: Throw down your key.

JERRY: It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.

ELAINE: I'll catch it!

JERRY: You'll chicken out at the last second.

ELAINE: Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?

JERRY: Alright.

ELAINE: Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me! We haven't done anything yet. I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?

JERRY: Alright. Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.



ELAINE: It went in the sewer!



JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: What are you doing?

JERRY: You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!

KRAMER: You just had to go looking for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do, oh, oh! You gotta know all about it. You're so obsessed with me.

JERRY: I'm gonna go let Elaine in.



KRAMER: What are you doing with her?



JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Security issue!



JERRY: Oh, hey. You got in.

ELAINE: Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here.



JERRY: Oh, thanks.



KRAMER: That wasn't me!

JERRY: So, he's definitely married, huh?

ELAINE: Uh...

JERRY: Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.



JERRY: Oh, come on!

ELAINE: Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.

KRAMER: Okay!





KRAMER: Alright, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement.

GEORGE: Jerry!



JERRY: George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!



JERRY: I believe this belongs to you.

KRAMER: Hey!






JERRY: Where did you get that?

GEORGE: I bought it.





Phil: Thanks.

JERRY: I'm sorry. I, I don't know you.

PHIL: What?

JERRY: There's been some robberies in the building. I, I can't let you in.

PHIL: But I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed and, and I forgot my key.

GEORGE: Sounds like a scam.



JERRY: I'm very sorry.





GEORGE: So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.

JERRY: Great, you're lonely and miserable again.



GEORGE: Feels right.



JERRY: Is that guy still there?



GEORGE: He's staring at us.

JERRY: Don't look at him.



JERRY: We don't hear that.



GEORGE: Want a bite?

JERRY: No, I don't.






GEORGE: I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit.



MAURA: Hey, honey.



GEORGE: What? Maura, what are you doing here? I ended this relationship... twice!

MAURA: George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.

GEORGE: Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break up?

MAURA: George, I listened to your arguments and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.



GEORGE: Alright.



MAURA: Ew, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot.






ELAINE: So, this is your little... love nest?



GLENN: It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.

ELAINE: Oh.

GLENN: Ah, should I light a fire?

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds... romantic.

GLENN: I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here.



ELAINE: This is wrong. I should go.



GLENN: Can you get that, please?

ELAINE: Oh, sure.



MSSMOTH: Where's Glenn?

ELAINE: Ah, you're the woman from the street and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home wrecker. I I I I I thought he was a superhero. I swear.

MSSMOTH: Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?

ELAINE: This is his home?

MSSMOTH: Yes.

ELAINE: So, he's...

MSSMOTH: Poor.





GLENN: I think this will burn!




JERRY: So you do live here.

PHIL: Yeah.





JERRY: You live on this floor?

PHIL: Yeah.



JERRY:  So you live right... there.

PHIL: Yeah.



JERRY: So I guess I'll...






ELAINE: He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. He's not married. He's poor.

JERRY: Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?

ELAINE: He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.

JERRY: So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?

ELAINE: How can I end it over money? I feel bad.

JERRY: Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?

ELAINE: Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.

JERRY: Good. How did you handle that?

ELAINE: Well, we gave him a few bucks and now he goes in the alley across the street.

JERRY: Same situation. Pay him off and you're clean.

ELAINE: Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. What am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?



GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, where have you been?

GEORGE: Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.

ELAINE: If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.

GEORGE: Who's this, Blue Arrow?

ELAINE: Green Lantern.

JERRY: We found out his super power was lack of money.

ELAINE: Alright.

JERRY: He's invulnerable to creditors.

ELAINE: We get it.



JERRY: He's the Got no Green Lantern.

ELAINE: Thank you.



GEORGE: Hey Elaine, maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.

ELAINE: Oh, well crafted.



GEORGE: Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.

JERRY: Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.

GEORGE: She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.



JERRY: Could you move over there?!



GEORGE: Hey, you know there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.

JERRY: Really? How come you never pursued her before?

GEORGE: She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.



ELAINE: Did I leave my glasses here?

JERRY: He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!

ELAINE: Keep them!






KRAMER: Heh.

JERRY: There's a giant parrot in the hallway.

KRAMER: It's Phil's.

JERRY: Who?

KRAMER: Our neighbor that you... turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.

JERRY: What did you tell him that for?

KRAMER: Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been trying to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.

JERRY: Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?

KRAMER: Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's.

JERRY: He let you?

KRAMER: No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without telling him. So uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You!






GEORGE: So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?

LORETTA: I was in Maine for a couple days.



GEORGE: Well... here we are.



LORETTA: George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.

GEORGE: Ho ho!



LORETTA: But I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.

GEORGE: Are you sure? Because it could really help me out of a jam.

LORETTA: I want to build something with you, George.

GEORGE: Oh, not more building.

LORETTA: And I won't take no for an answer.



GEORGE: No?

LORETTA: No.



GEORGE: Alright.






ELAINE: So uh, what are we doing in this alley anyway?

GLENN: It's a surprise.

ELAINE: Oh.



ELAINE: What are you doing? What is that?

GLENN: It's a bag of donuts.

ELAINE: It's garbage.

GLENN: No no no no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.

ELAINE: Alright, that's it.



ELAINE: How do you spell your last name?

GLENN: It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.

ELAINE: I'll make it out to cash. How about two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?

GLENN: Oh!

ELAINE: Make it three hundred.

GLENN: You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life.



ELAINE: Aw, Glenn.






JERRY: Hi. Is Phil here?

Phil: Yeah, I'm here.



JERRY: Phil. Hi. I, I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely by the way, made a mess on my door.

PHIL: And?

JERRY: I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid there.

PHIL: That's my wife.

JERRY: Alright, I think we're done here.






JERRY: So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.

GEORGE: This isn't going well.

JERRY: I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without them I have no in!

GEORGE: You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! "Jerry"!



JERRY: Where are you going? Help me look!

GEORGE: It's a big night. I'm uh, ice skating with one and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.

JERRY: Which is with who?

GEORGE: It doesn't matter.





KRAMER: Whoa! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.

JERRY: I can't go until I find my cufflinks.

KRAMER: Yeah, see? I knew you would lose them. That's why I took them out of your dresser drawer and put them in my strongbox.

JERRY: You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?

KRAMER: Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, huh?



KRAMER: Hey, what's going on?

PHIL: Fredo is dead.



JERRY: That strange Portuguese guy that lives next door to the incinerator?

PHIL: No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.



JERRY: Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.

PHIL: Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.

JERRY: But I, I didn't, I...



JERRY: Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a bird?

KRAMER: Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy and he puts it in the incinerator.

JERRY: Just get the key and let's get out of here.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.



KRAMER: You know, it's a, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoa! That's a weird coincidence.

JERRY: Kramer!



KRAMER: What?

JERRY: You killed Fredo!

KRAMER: Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!

JERRY: Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box and the key is in the bird. What are we gonna do?



KRAMER: You just answered your own question.

JERRY: Oh no!

KRAMER: I'll get the shovel.






GEORGE: The uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.

LORETTA: What?

GEORGE: I mean uh, I had fun ice skating.

LORETTA: Oh.



MAURA: George?

GEORGE: Maura.



GEORGE: Oh my God! What are you doing here?!

MAURA: You told me to meet you here for lunch.

GEORGE: Uh! I'm caught in my own web of lies!



MAURA: I'm Maura.



LORETTA: I'm Loretta. You want to join us?



GEORGE: This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives.



GEORGE: Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so...



MAURA: George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.

LORETTA: So can we.

GEORGE: What? So, this is still not over?

MAURA: No.

GEORGE: You?

LORETTA: No.



GEORGE: Alright.






GLENN: Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?

ELAINE: Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood so you won't have to burn them.



GLENN: Oh my God, Alison. You're home early.

ELAINE: Who is this?

ALISON: His wife.

ELAINE: You're... poor and married?

GLENN: Looks like it.

ALISON: Who the hell are you?

ELAINE: I guess I'm... Lois Loan.




JERRY: Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.

KRAMER: "Man's best friend". Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.

JERRY: Oh my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up!



KRAMER: Alright, then you're the one getting the key out of him.



JERRY: I'll dig.

KRAMER: Listen, I heard that Lassie number three is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.





JERRY: Well, that was easy.



PHIL: Alright honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.



JERRY: Hey Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!



PHIL: Oh my God!



JERRY: Hey neighbor.




GEORGE: Alright. I'm gonna try giving them fifty-five dollars each. What do you think?

ELAINE: Give me forty, you'll never see me again.



ELAINE: So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here or are you gonna move out or what?

JERRY: Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.



GEORGE: So, what's in the cooler?





KRAMER: Oh. Well, would you look at that.



KRAMER: I guess I forgot to lock it.

JERRY: You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?

KRAMER: Well, this is one for the books, huh Jerry? Really one for the books!
