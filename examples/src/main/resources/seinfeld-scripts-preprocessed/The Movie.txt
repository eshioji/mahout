Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips it, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, your selling the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.




JERRY: I don't understand, the show's delayed? Why?

KERNIS: I don't know. Guy told me to hold it for fifteen minutes.

JERRY: You don't understand, I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at nine fifty, I'm not gonna be able to make it!

KERNIS: I hear you guy.

JERRY: And I'm doing Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!

KERNIS: Let me see what I can do.



JERRY: Oh no, buckles? Your not going to put him on tonight are you?

KERNIS: No. He hangs around in case somebody drops out. Look, why don't you come back and do the eleven o'clock spot?

JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie "Checkmate" at ten thirty.



JERRY: Alright, forget the movie, I'll do the eleven o'clock spot. I'll be back.



BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!

JERRY: Hey...






GEORGE: Excuse me, do you have a ticket?

MANINMOVIELINE: No.

GEORGE: Okay. Good.




MORY: You missed your spot, it was nine fifteen

JERRY: Mory I'm positive you told me nine fifty.

MORY: In any event, I had no alternative but to reassign your spot to one of your peers who posseses a clearer understanding of our scheduling policy.



BUCKLES: Jerry!

JERRY: What are you doing here?

BUCKLES: Hey, do you think this is funny? "Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time and believe me, he's no athlete!"

JERRY: I got to leave.

BUCKLES: Where?

JERRY: Movies.

BUCKLES: I thought you told Kernis you were going back to do the eleven o'clock.

JERRY: I am, I'm just going to stop by the theatre and tell my friends that  can't make it.

BUCKLES: Well that's cool, I'll split a cab with you.

JERRY: I could be a while over there.

BUCKLES: I got time! It will give us a chance to get to know one another a little better.








ELAINE: Hey.



ELAINE: Where is everybody?

GEORGE: Everybody's late because they know good old George will get in line early.

ELAINE: Oh, I've been dying to see "Checkmate".

GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as "Ponce de Leon", I'll be happy.

ELAINE: "Ponce de Leon?" Are you kidding me? I hated that movie! 

GEORGE: "Ponce de Leon?" But that was great!

ELAINE: Oh come on. That fountain of youth scene at the end where they're all splashing around and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! That is so stupid!

GEORGE: Let me tell you something. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed and that tear started to roll down his cheek I lost it.



KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Where have you been?

KRAMER: Up around the corner at the Paradise Twin

ELAINE: Well I told you the Paragon.

KRAMER: No, you said Paradise. I mean it's playing there too you know.

ELAINE: No, I would never said Paradise, that's a twin theatre. I want to see this movie on a big screen.



KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Papaya King.

ELAINE: No, wait!

GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!

KRAMER: I'm starving, I haven't had any dinner!

ELAINE: Well you can get a hot dog at the theater.

KRAMER: I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! I want a Papaya King hot dog!

ELAINE: Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second and then this line is going to start moving and we're going to end up in the front row.

KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.



ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat saving incident!

KRAMER: Well give me my ticket then.

GEORGE: I don't have them yet.

ELAINE: What do you mean you don't have them yet?

GEORGE: I'm in the line to buy.

ELAINE: No George, this is the ticket holder�s line.

GEORGE: No it's not, it's the ticket buyers line.

ELAINE: Then how come we're not moving?

KRAMER: Good question.



GEORGE: Is this the ticket holder�s line or the buyers?



MANINMOVIELINE: Holders.



GEORGE: But I asked you before if you had a ticket and you said no!

MANINMOVIELINE: I didn't. My friend was getting it.

GEORGE: Good. It's good to be accurate like that. Alright, stay here, I'll go get tickets.

ELAINE: Can you believe him?

KRAMER: He's spaced out.



ELAINE: How long would you have stood in the ticket holder�s line?



ELAINE: Yeah, exactly.



GEORGE: Sold out.

ELAINE: Oh, real good George. Real good.

GEORGE: Hey, hey I asked the guy if he had a ticket!

KRAMER: Alright, what time is it?



GEORGE: Twenty after ten.

KRAMER: Alright, they got one at the Paradise at ten forty-five.

ELAINE: No, I don't wanna go to a mini-plex multi-theater!

GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?

ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POW's to show them propaganda films.

GEORGE: Alright, I'm going.

ELAINE: Well what about Jerry?

KRAMER: Alright, you guys go get the tickets, I'll wait right here.

GEORGE: Terrific. Alright, alright come on.








BUCKLES: So then when I was twelve the whole family moved from Bensonhurst to Sheephead Bay.

JERRY: Mmm hmm.

BUCKLES: We live right on the water. The whole atmosphere stunk from fish. You know that fishy smell I'm talking about?



JERRY: Yeah, yeah the fishy smell.

BUCKLES: To this day I won't eat fish. Do you eat fish?

JERRY: Yes! Yes I eat fish!

BUCKLES: I don't know how you can eat that crap!

JERRY:  Take the Park!

BUCKLES: No no no, take fifty-fifth. No, there's beautiful homes there. Lovely, talented, attractive people there.




GEORGE: Got them.

ELAINE: Beautiful!

GEORGE: Hey, you know what else is playing here?

ELAINE: Huh.

GEORGE: "Rochelle Rochelle."

ELAINE: Ugh.

GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seeing that.

ELAINE: Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most pointless, boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.

GEORGE: So what's your point?

GEORGE: Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.

ELAINE: Oh, alright. Can you break a twenty?

GEORGE: No, I don't, I don't have any change.

ELAINE: Oh well, then I'll pay you later.

GEORGE: Or, I could take the twenty, I could, I could pay you later.

ELAINE: Yeah, you could...

GEORGE: Might be easier.

ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.

GEORGE: Either way.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's the same thing

GEORGE: So... can I have it?

ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.

GEORGE: What do you mean "get the popcorn and the soda"?

ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda and we'll call it even.

GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, I will buy you a popcorn and soda and I'll throw in a bon-bons.

ELAINE: George, you're sapping my strength.



ELAINE: What about Kramer and Jerry?

GEORGE: Alright, I'll wait out here for them. You go in and save seats.

ELAINE: Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!

GEORGE: Go on, save them.

ELAINE: No, but George! George!








JERRY: Fifty-fith, great idea, Saturday night theatre traffic, good move!

BUCKLES: I wonder how my attorney would react in traffic. You better move that car girl for I bust you up. What about Jose Philesiano. It's noboy I can't see. I had to sit here for two hours, I don't think so. It can be anybody. People down through history reacting in traffic. Franklin Roosevelt. Driver...

JERRY: Alright! Alright! I got the bit!

BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.

JERRY: That's very nice of you, I can't do the voices.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Don't start up with me!

JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab.

BUCKLES: But Jerry, quit riffing!

JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?



BUCKLES: Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?




ELAINE: No, these are saved.

MANINSIDETHEATRE: All of them?

ELAINE: Yeah.

ELAINE: Come on, you can't take four seats.

ELAINE: What, is that a rule?





WOMANINTHEATRE: Are these your things?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.



GEORGE: Elaine, they didn't show. I can't any more I'm going to miss the beginning.

WOMANINTHEATRE: We'll take these seats. Would you please remove your stuff.

ELAINE: No no, they'll be here.

WOMANINTHEATRE: But I am here, they are not!

ELAINE: They're comming. George listen, run over to the Paragon and give Kramer the two tickets so they can come in, okay?



ELAINE: These are taken, taken. If you hurry back you won't miss the beginning.

GEORGE: Why don't you go and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.



ELAINE: No, taken, taken, taken. I'm getting the hang of it.



GEORGE: Why don't you give me the twenty and I'll stop and get change and then you and I can uh, you know, settle.

ELAINE: Can we do this later, George?

GEORGE: What's the point of even discussing it? You'll give me the money when you have it.



GEORGE: I, I trust you.




KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? Ah, you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh, a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?








ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. They're in the lobby buying popcorn. What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!

WOMANINTHEATRE: Which one?

ELAINE: These two and this one. No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! They're taken!



ELAINE: Ah, take them.






GEORGE: Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, a pointed nose?

MOVIECLERK: Flared nostrils?

GEORGE: Yeah.

MOVIECLERK: Nope, haven't seen him.






BUCKLES: Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, please let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?

JERRY: Your trench coat in my closet?

BUCKLES: Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills. I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.

JERRY: I can't keep your coat in my closet.

BUCKLES: I'm sorry you feel that way.

JERRY: Well, that's life.

BUCKLES: Hey, your freinds aren't here.

JERRY: Oh, they must be inside. I'm just going to run inside and tell them I can't make the movie.

BUCKLES: We should see "Rochelle Rochelle." I hear it's really hot.

JERRY: No thanks, maybe some other time.

BUCKLES: Really? Do you really mean that?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BUCKLES: You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?

JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.



JERRY: Here. See you later.

BUCKLES: Do you want me to wait for you?

JERRY: No, don't wait!

BUCKLES: Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure you get in, that's all.



JERRY: Ah, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to them. You mind if I walk through real quick?





JERRY: Go ahead.

BUCKLES: Bye bye.




KRAMER: Hey, did that guy show up?

MOVIECLERK: The guy with the horse face and the big teeth.

KRAMER: No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.

MOVIECLERK: Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses. Looked like Humpty Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.




WOMANINTHEATRE: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that? And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-syncing to "A Chorus Line", I mean you can see he's got talent.



ELAINE: Excuse me, excuse me?

WOMANINTHEATRE: What's the problem?



ELAINE: You're talking.

WOMANINTHEATRE: It's the "Coming Attractions".



WOMANINTHEATRE: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a...




MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: Uh, I just went out. I went to look for my friend?

MOVIEUSHER: Do you have your stub?

GEORGE: My "stub"?

MOVIEUSHER: Uh huh.



GEORGE: You don't remember me?

MOVIEUSHER: It's a big city, sir.

GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kind of short, big wall of hair, face like a frying pan?






GEORGE: Elaine? Elaine! Elaine!



GEORGE: Elaine!






JERRY: Elaine.













ELAINE: Uh, could I have a medium diet Coke?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Do you want the medium size or the middle size?

ELAINE: What's the difference?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Well, we have three sizes. Medium, large, and jumbo.

ELAINE: What happened to the small?

CONCESSIONCLERK: There is no small. Small is Medium.

ELAINE: What's... medium?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Medium is large, and large is jumbo.

ELAINE: Okay. Give me the large.

CONCESSIONCLERK: That's medium.

ELAINE: Right. Yeah. Could I have a small popcorn?

CONCESSIONCLERK: There is no small. Child size is small.

ELAINE: What's medium?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Adult.

ELAINE: Do adults ever order the child size?

CONCESSIONCLERK: Not usually.

ELAINE: Okay, give me the adult.

CONCESSIONCLERK: Do you want butter?

ELAINE: Is it real butter?

CONCESSIONCLERK: It's butter flavored!

ELAINE: What is it made of?

CONCESSIONCLERK: It's yellow!




JERRY: Forty-fourth and ninth.

TAXIDRIVER: Have you got a cigarette?

JERRY: No.




MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

GEORGE: We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!

MOVIEUSHER: I need to see your stub.

GEORGE: I've got the stub.



GEORGE: There you go, okay? That's my other friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.




MOVIEUSHER: Ticket, sir?

KRAMER: Uh no, see my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late and she's inside.

MOVIEUSHER: Go ahead.




KRAMER: Is that seat taken?

WOMANINTHEATRE: It's all yours.




TAXIDRIVER: I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.

JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?

TAXIDRIVER: No! Impossible! It is on empty!





















ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh...



ELAINE:  I just went to get popcorn, okay? And, and, and somebody took my seat and my coat is in there!

MOVIEUSHER: There's a seat in the front row.

ELAINE: No no, I can't sit in the front row.

MOVIEUSHER: Well, you're going to have to wait then.

ELAINE: I can't stand around here for two hours!

MOVIEUSHER: I could let you see "Rochelle Rochelle".

ELAINE: Oh thanks.



ELAINE: Oh hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus with a, with a bird face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?

MOVIEUSHER: Haven't seen him.










JERRY: Hey, did I make it?

KERNIS: Sorry.

JERRY: Oh great. That's great. What a night.







JERRY: You got my spot?

BUCKLES: That athlete's foot bit killed!

JERRY: Really.

BUCKLES: Do you think I need to lose some weight?

JERRY: Weight? Nah, just need some more height. My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies.

BUCKLES: Come on, we can still catch most of "Rochelle Rochelle".

JERRY: "Rochelle Rochelle", huh?

BUCKLES: A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

JERRY: Minsk?




ELAINE: Oh, give me a break!



JERRY: Elaine?



ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: Elaine!

VOICEINTHEATRE: Shut up.

GEORGE: Jerry?

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: Elaine?

ELAINE: George!



JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?

VOICEINTHEATRE: Will you shut up?

ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!

JERRY: Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

BUCKLES: You're leaving?

JERRY: Yeah.



BUCKLES: Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.

JERRY: I don't want the coat.

BUCKLES: Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!



GEORGE: Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.

JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!

GEORGE: I still paid for it!




JERRY: I only have a twenty.

ELAINE: That's my coat! Give me that. Where did you get that?

KRAMER: It was on the seat.

ELAINE: You took my seat!?

GEORGE: You uh, owe me for the ticket.

KRAMER: Yeah right.

ELAINE: What is that stain on my coat?

KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?




JERRY: I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the beginning? Oh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out.



JERRY: "Why did they kill that guy? Why did they kill him? Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't really with them. I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him."
