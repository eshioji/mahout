

WAITRESS: Careful, this plate is extremely hot.



ELAINE: Thank you. Ow!

WAITRESS: I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?

ELAINE: I just wanted to know what your idea of hot is.



PUDDY: Hey babe. You ready to hit the ice?

ELAINE: I am ready to skate up a...



ELAINE: Why are you wearing that?

PUDDY: It's my winter coat.

ELAINE: A fur?



PUDDY: Is there a problem?

ELAINE: A seemingly infinite supply.



ELAINE: Ow! Careful, it's hot.



PUDDY: Ow!




JERRY: So, Puddy wear's a man fur?

ELAINE: He was strutting around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.

JERRY: And of course you find fur morally reprehensible.

ELAINE: Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.

GEORGE: And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?

ELAINE: We never dated in winter.

JERRY: You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.

ELAINE: Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.

GEORGE: An apartment warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.

JERRY: Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're getting him.

GEORGE: Alright, but we're not buying it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.

JERRY: Cheapness is not a sense.

ELAINE: I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in he's got you working for him. "Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?" Ugh.

JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: You got any pliers?

JERRY: What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?

NEWMAN: Hilarious.

KRAMER: Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: To prevent an ambush.

KRAMER: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.

JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.

KRAMER: Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyeful, well, we say, "Enjoy the show."

ELAINE: I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.



JERRY: Hey George, here's the model number on that chair by the way.

KRAMER: Mmm... nice wallet.

NEWMAN: Wallet.

JERRY: What?



KRAMER: Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.

JERRY: That's a five.




KRAMER: I'm on the Mexican, whoa oh, radio...



SILVIO: Eh, what are you doing?

KRAMER: Hey Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.

SILVIO: Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?

KRAMER: Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?

SILVIO: Like what?

KRAMER: Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll um, I'll switch it back.

SILVIO: No no no no, that's alright.

KRAMER: Well, that's good. Because uh, Newman and I...

SILVIO: Newman? He did this too?

KRAMER: Well, yeah.

SILVIO: I deal with him.




GEORGE: Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're getting for Joe Mayo, sixty dollars cheaper.

JERRY: Except the store's in Delaware.

GEORGE: I'll have them overnight it.

JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.

GEORGE: It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb...



GEORGE: ...and a wallet for your money.

JERRY: But look at this thing.



JERRY: It's, it's huge.



JERRY: You got more cow here than here.

GEORGE: I need everything in there.



JERRY: Irish money?

GEORGE: I might go there.



JERRY: Show this card at any participating Orlando area Exxon stations to get your free "Save the Tiger" poster.



GEORGE: Alright, just give me that. And give me some of those Sweet and Lows.




KRAMER: Who is it?

NEWMAN: It's Newman.

KRAMER: What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.

NEWMAN: I can't believe I'm being evicted.

KRAMER: What? What are you talking about?

NEWMAN: The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.

KRAMER: No no, he can't do that.

NEWMAN: I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the train yard eating out of a bucket.

KRAMER: Come on, we'll go and talk to him and we'll straighten this thing out.



NEWMAN: Uh, you uh, you better put something on.




JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.

GEORGE: A man carries a wallet.

JERRY: You know the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.



JOEMAYO: Hey Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Joe Mayo. Nice place.

JOEMAYO: Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?



GEORGE: Love to.

JOEMAYO: Thanks. Jerry...

JERRY: Music?

JOEMAYO: Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?

JERRY: But I could do that and the music.

JOEMAYO: Oh no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!

JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it.



PUDDY: Hey.

JERRY: Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE: Hey. I think you know Dr. Zaius.



JERRY: So Elaine, notice anything different about my pants?



ELAINE: So George, did you get the chair?

GEORGE: No, I don't have it yet.

JERRY: So, we're giving him nothing?



GEORGE: No, I brought a picture of the chair.

JERRY: Did you at least get him a card?

GEORGE: I thought we'd all sign the picture.



JOEMAYO: Elaine.

ELAINE: Hey, Joe Mayo.

JOEMAYO: I need you to be in charge of coats.

ELAINE: Oh, fantastic.

JOEMAYO: And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my sound system?

PUDDY: Sure thing, Joe Mayo.



JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?

KERI: Nice.

JERRY: It's working. Don't tap on the glass.



GEORGE: Joe Mayo's apartment.

PUDDY: Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.




ELAINE: Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.




SILVIO: Why are we in Jerry's apartment?

KRAMER: Well, I uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere you know, with the shelves and the furniture.

SILVIO: Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.

KRAMER: Oh, well um, Newman thinks that you uh, evicted him?

SILVIO: I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.

KRAMER: Look, I've known Newman all my life in the building and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly yes, but smart as a whip.

SILVIO: Okay, on your word he can stay.

KRAMER: Alright.

SILVIO: But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

KRAMER: Well, you won't regret it.



SILVIO: What's wrong?






JOEMAYO: Elaine, thanks for coming.

ELAINE: Good working with you.



PUDDY: Alright, let's hit the bricks.



ELAINE: What?

JOEMAYO: Hey, I got a coat just like this!

ELAINE: Oh. Uh...




ELAINE: So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

GEORGE: And you threw it out the window?

ELAINE: Mmm hmm.

GEORGE: God, you're like a rock star.

ELAINE: So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.

JERRY: Because you threw it out.

ELAINE: No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.

JERRY: But you did actually throw his coat out the window.

ELAINE: But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.

JERRY: But that's you.

ELAINE: So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat even though I don't think I should be held responsible which I am anyway.



GEORGE: Well, I'm satisfied. Oh, my back is killing me.

JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You, you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.



GEORGE: This is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.

ELAINE: Look at you. You're on a slant.

GEORGE: Here, just give me a couple of napkins.



GEORGE: There, there I'm fine.



JERRY: What was that?

GEORGE: I think I had some hard candy in there.




GEORGE: No no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.



GEORGE: Ah. How does this thing work?



GEORGE: Ah...

DELIVERYMAN: Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?



GEORGE: Ah...




KERI: Ready to go?

JERRY: All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.

KERI: You don't go that often?

JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?



KERI: Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?

JERRY: Compact, lipstick, all this?



KERI: And can you help to carry my keys?

JERRY: What are you, a medieval dungeon master?



KERI: And a tin of Altoids.



JERRY: Ow! Sharp key.




KRAMER: So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?

NEWMAN: Well, there's very little sleeping going on.

KRAMER: Well, why didn't you tell me about this?

NEWMAN: Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.

KRAMER: Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.



NEWMAN: Hey, what is that up that tree?

KRAMER: Oh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.

NEWMAN: No, that's a fur coat! Hey uh, give me a boost.



KRAMER: Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?

NEWMAN: The Pacific Northwest.




ELAINE: So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.

JERRY: You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet and I want to keep that weight off.

ELAINE: You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.

JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?

ELAINE: No no, it's a small men's carryall.

JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse.

ELAINE: It's not a purse. It's European.

JERRY: Oh.

ELAINE: Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?



JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: If I'm getting him a new fur, I'm not chipping in on a gift, too.



GEORGE: Yeah?

JERRY: Hey George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?

GEORGE: Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: It's in... transit.

ELAINE: Did he get it?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.

GEORGE: What, she's out?

JERRY: Well, so what? You're getting a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.

GEORGE: Alright!

JERRY: What is that noise?

GEORGE: That's my toaster. I got to go. Oh!

JERRY: You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.



KRAMER: Hey. Oh uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back.



KRAMER: Weak hinge.

ELAINE: Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.

KRAMER: Oh, go down to eighty-eighth street. They're free.

ELAINE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring tailed lemur!

ELAINE: Eighty-eighth street? That's where Joe Mayo lives.



ELAINE: That's the coat!

JERRY: What was that pop sound?

KRAMER: Well, I had some hard candy in there.




NEWMAN: So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?



ELAINE: Come in, come in.

NEWMAN: Ah! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.

ELAINE: Please, sit down. Newman um, I wanted to talk to you about something.

NEWMAN: This isn't about my opening your mail?

ELAINE: What?

NEWMAN: Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.

ELAINE: Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine and I'd like to give it back to him.

NEWMAN: Sorry. Climbers, keepers.

ELAINE: You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.

NEWMAN: You are?

ELAINE: Oh yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.

NEWMAN: Well, it's, it's interesting work. I don't mind it. Don't you have a, a boyfriend? A uh, burly, athletic type?

ELAINE: Uh, don't worry, he's cool.

NEWMAN: Cool?

ELAINE: Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?

NEWMAN: Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife and I have given the coat to her.

ELAINE: Alright, we're done here.

NEWMAN: For I am in love with Svetlana and I don't care if the whole world knows except for Silvio who would throw me out of the apartment where I would be dancing on the sidewalk...

ELAINE: Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.




KERI: Nice carryall.

JERRY: It's European.

KERI: Do you still have my lipstick?

JERRY: Uh yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?

KERI: My job was to keep you away from the music.

JERRY: What, he doesn't like my taste in music?

KERI: Guess not.

JERRY: You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!




SILVIO: Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.

KRAMER: Hey, Silvio!



SILVIO: Look at this.

KRAMER: Huh?

SILVIO: Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?

KRAMER: Relax, Silvio.

SILVIO: No, that's it. You're both out of the building!

KRAMER: Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!

SILVIO: A man's?

KRAMER: Yeah.

SILVIO: What kind of a man would wear fur?

KRAMER: Oh, lots of them.

SILVIO: Would you?

KRAMER: No.

SILVIO: Then who?

KRAMER: What about Jerry?

SILVIO: Jerry?

KRAMER: Yeah sure, he's a celebrity. Oh yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.

SILVIO: Yes, you are right. It's all about me me me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!

KRAMER: Yeah, something like that.




JERRY: I have to do what?

KRAMER: All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.

JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.

KRAMER: Well, then Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.

JERRY: Is that right?

KRAMER: Alright, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?

JERRY: Newman, too?

KRAMER: Oh, come on man! Well, I'll tell you what. If you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.

JERRY: That's my walkman!

KRAMER: And you'll get it back.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.

GEORGE: Hey.

KRAMER: Oh hey, and by the way uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.



JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?

GEORGE: It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop riding me?

JERRY: You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.

GEORGE: Excuse me?

JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not getting a gift from me.

GEORGE: Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out too! So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?!

KRAMER: Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?

GEORGE: He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.

KRAMER: I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.

GEORGE: Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?

JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.

GEORGE: I already bought it! I've been lying to you for three days and now you're all screwing me!

JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?

GEORGE: I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.

JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!

GEORGE: Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair and it will be easy because the receipt is in my good friend.

JERRY: Your good friend is morbidly obese.

GEORGE: Well, at least I'm not carrying a purse.

JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!

KRAMER: Alright, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.

JERRY: Alright.



KRAMER: There you go.

JERRY: How do I look?

KRAMER: Odd.




GEORGE: Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.



GEORGE: My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!




JERRY: Hey Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.

SILVIO: That is your coat?

JERRY: It sure is.

SILVIO: Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.

JERRY: That's true.



KRAMER: Jerry, you forgot your purse.

JERRY: Oh, thanks.

KRAMER: Hey Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.

JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.

KRAMER: Alright, you're not fancy!

SILVIO: No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!



ELAINE: Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.

JERRY: No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.

ELAINE: No, that's not your coat.

SILVIO: If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?

ELAINE: It's Joe Mayo's coat.

SILVIO: Who's Joe Mayo?

KRAMER: That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.



JERRY: Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!

POLICEMAN: Your what?

JERRY: The... black leather... thing with a strap.

POLICEMAN: You mean a purse?

JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!




JERRY: So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?

ELAINE: Yeah, he was waiting inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.

JERRY: He should have had a reverse peephole.



PUDDY: Hey, Babe.



JERRY: Hello? Hello?

ELAINE: What is that?

PUDDY: It's my new coat.

ELAINE: You ditched the fur?

PUDDY: Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! Eight ball! You got a question, you ask the eight ball.

ELAINE: You're gonna wear this all the time?

PUDDY: All signs point to "Yes!"
