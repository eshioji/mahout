

JERRY: There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to them. I guess eventually when like aliens land in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going, "I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?" 




GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't want nice. 

JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy. 

GEORGE: Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society are we living in when nice is bad? 

JERRY: What's that smell? What are you wearing? 

GEORGE: What? Little cologne. 

JERRY: Manly. 

GEORGE: Monica wants me to wear it. 

JERRY: So why didn't you say no? 

GEORGE: I'm too nice. 

JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably back in Pakistan. They're waiting for him to send back money. This is horrible. 

GEORGE: She wants me to take an IQ test. 

JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne. 

GEORGE: No. She's taking this course in education for her masters. Its part of her research project so I have to be a guinea pig. 

JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a toady. 

GEORGE: You know I can't talk to you anymore. 

JERRY: Alright, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test. 

GEORGE: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart. 

JERRY: Who thinks you're smart? 

GEORGE: I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing. 

JERRY: What thing? 

GEORGE: You don't listen when people talk to you anymore! 

JERRY: Oh, oh the IQ thing, yeah. 

GEORGE: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for fifteen years. 

JERRY: What'd you get? 

GEORGE: What did I get or what do I say I got? 

JERRY: What do you say? 

GEORGE: I say fourteen o nine. 

JERRY: Fourteen o nine, that's a good score. 

GEORGE: You're telling me. 

JERRY: What did you really get? 

GEORGE: You are my friend, right?

JERRY: Of course. 

GEORGE: I tell you everything, right? 

JERRY: I hope so. 

GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave. 




JERRY: He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in. 

ELAINE: Why do you keep watching? 

JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know he's not going to make it, you kind of root for him for a second.

ELAINE: And then you flush. 

JERRY: Well, it's a spider. 

ELAINE: You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place if they don't see anyone else in there. 



ELAINE: Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying. 

JERRY: Bazooka Joe. 



JERRY: The buzzer. 

ELAINE: It's your house. 

JERRY: My house? You got to be on the lease to press to buzzer?



JERRY: Yeah? 

GEORGE: It's George. 

JERRY: Come on up. 

ELAINE: Casus belli. 

JERRY: What's that? 

ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud. 

JERRY: Come on, go in, go in! 

ELAINE: Have you gone in there? 

JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking and I'll end up partners with him. 



GEORGE: Hey. 

JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor. 



GEORGE: I'm wearing some cologne, alright? 

ELAINE: Sure, fine. 

JERRY: Casus belli. 

ELAINE: Casus belli. 

GEORGE: What's that? 

ELAINE: Since when do you wear cologne? 

GEORGE: Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live. 

JERRY: Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test? 

GEORGE: I didn't take it yet. 

ELAINE: What IQ test? 

GEORGE: What's casus belli?

JERRY: Oh, it's nothing.

GEORGE: Is it about me? 

JERRY: Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live? 

ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test? 

JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course. 

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like fun. 

GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. 

ELAINE: You'll do well, you're smart. 

JERRY: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not. 

ELAINE: What did you get on your SAT's? 

GEORGE: It varies. 

JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ. 

ELAINE: Huh, mine's one forty-five. 

GEORGE: One forty-five! 

JERRY: Get out of here! 

ELAINE: You get out of here! 

JERRY: You get out of here! 



GEORGE: Maybe you should take the test for me. 

JERRY: Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. 

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again? 

ELAINE: What? 

GEORGE: You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out of a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor. 

ELAINE: Are you serious? 

GEORGE: Why not? 

ELAINE: Where would I take the test? 

GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop. 

ELAINE: No, that would be too noisy. 

JERRY: Take it at the Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep. 



ELAINE: Hey, what do you think? 

JERRY: Hey, I love a good caper. 

ELAINE: Yeah, that's what it is, a caper. 

GEORGE: You'll do it? 

ELAINE: What the hey. 

GEORGE: Yeah, beautiful!



GEORGE: Sorry.




BABU: Welcome to the Dream Cafe. 

JERRY: Well uh, I've been looking forward to it. 

BABU: Oh, how did you hear about us? 

JERRY: Uh, people, people are talking. 

BABU: Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both. 

JERRY: Uh, non-smoking would be great. 

BABU: Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot face cloth for your pleasure. 



JERRY: Thank you.



BABU: Our specials are tacos, moussaka, and franks and beans. 

JERRY: Well uh, what, what do you recommend my good fellow? 

BABU: Oh, the turkey. 

JERRY: Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years. 

BABU: You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind.



JERRY: Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. Alright, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel prize? 




GEORGE: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. 

MONICA: But why? 

GEORGE: I can't concentrate in front of you. 

MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything. 

GEORGE: Are you kidding me?



GEORGE: This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence. 

MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it. 

GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that.



GEORGE: And now if you'll excuse me, I would like to get started please. 

MONICA: Good luck. 

GEORGE: Don't need it. 



ELAINE: What's going on in there? I've been standing here for twenty minutes. 

GEORGE: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this. 

ELAINE: Alright, what time do you want me back here? 

GEORGE: Uh, twenty to three. 

ELAINE: Okay. 

GEORGE: Thanks again. 

ELAINE: Alright. 

GEORGE: And don't settle for one forty-five, you can do better, you're a genius. 




JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say. 

BABU: It is indeed my pleasure. 

JERRY: Oh, please.



BABU: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today... 

ELAINE: Oh, no no, I'll just have uh, tea and toast. 

BABU: Tea and toast. 

JERRY: Eat something! Babu... 

ELAINE: Um, okay, Well I'll have the rigatoni. 

BABU: Oh, very good choice. Very good. 



JERRY: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. 

ELAINE: I know. 



KRAMER: Hey. 

JERRY: Hey.



KRAMER: Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Hey. 

KRAMER: This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back. 

JERRY: So? 

KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back. 

JERRY: Why not? 

KRAMER: Because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him? 



KRAMER: Oh, gees.

ELAINE: Okay, yeah, okay.



KRAMER: Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that? 

JERRY: Statute. 

KRAMER: What? 

JERRY: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. 

KRAMER: No, statue. 

JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. 

KRAMER: Just wait a minute. Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations? 

ELAINE: Statute. 

KRAMER: Oh, I really think you're wrong. 

ELAINE: Look Kramer, I have to take this test okay? I don't have a lot of time. 

KRAMER: What test?



ELAINE: An IQ test. 

KRAMER: Why are you taking an IQ test? 

ELAINE: It's for George. 

KRAMER: George? 

ELAINE: Yeah, look, can I explain it to you later? 

KRAMER: But why are you taking an IQ test for George? 

ELAINE: Would you please?! 

KRAMER: What, is it for a job or something? 

ELAINE: Later! 

KRAMER: You're positive it's statute? 

ELAINE: Yes, yes! 



BABU: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth for your...






MONICA: George? 

GEORGE: Yeah? 

MONICA: The door is locked. 

GEORGE: Oh, it's locked? 

MONICA: I need to get something. 

GEORGE: Monica I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. 

MONICA: George! 

GEORGE: Wish I could. 




ELAINE: Babu! If you don't mind? 



ELAINE: Oh my God! It's all over the test! 

BABU: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. 

ELAINE: Oh man! Look at this I'm out of time and I'm late anyway. 

BABU: Please, forgive me, please.

JERRY: Go ahead, I'll take care of it. 

BABU: I'm very sorry. Tell your friends! 

JERRY: It's alright, she was cheating anyway. 

BABU: You're a very kind man. 

JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right? 

BABU: Yes, Pakistani, yes. 

JERRY: Babu, may I say something? 

BABU: Of course, you're very smart man, I'll listen. 

JERRY: I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say the franks and beans for example. 

BABU: But there are no Pakistani people here. 

JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood. 

BABU: Yes, you see everything, don't you? 

JERRY: Well, not everything. I do what I can. 

BABU: I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special. 





JERRY: I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be? 




ELAINE: It was an accident. 

GEORGE: What did you go on a picnic? 

ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it. 

GEORGE: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? 

MONICA: Time's up George. 

GEORGE: Okay.



GEORGE: Here you go. 

MONICA: How did you do? 

GEORGE: Piece of cake. 

MONICA: What happened to the test? 

GEORGE: What? I spilled some food on it. 

MONICA: Food? What food? 

GEORGE: What are you talking about? 

MONICA: Where did you get food? 

GEORGE: From my pocket. 

MONICA: What? 

GEORGE: I uh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. 

MONICA: And coffee? 

GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. 

MONICA: Where did you get the coffee? 

GEORGE: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. 

MONICA: How did you get there? 

GEORGE: I walked. 

MONICA: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave. 

GEORGE: I climbed out the window. 

MONICA: You climbed out the window? 

GEORGE: Of course. 

MONICA: Why didn't you go out the door? 

GEORGE: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here. 

MONICA: You are a fascinating man, George Costanza. 




JERRY: The average person sees a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me. 

ELAINE: You're very special. 



KRAMER: Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes around looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am. 

JERRY: Of course, I always do. 

KRAMER: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 

ELAINE: Just give it back to him. 

KRAMER: Oh, he'll have to kill me.





JERRY: Hey Georgie! 

GEORGE: Coming up. 

JERRY: How did you do on the IQ test?! 

GEORGE: Eighty-five! 

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: Eighty-five, Jerry! Eighty-five IQ! 



ELAINE: Eighty-five? 

JERRY: Well well well... 

ELAINE: He's coming up? 

JERRY: Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds. 

ELAINE: Yeah, but an eighty-five, that's ridiculous. 

JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles.



GEORGE: Oh, hello professor. 

ELAINE: George, I cannot believe... 

GEORGE: Please.

ELAINE: No there has got be a mistake. 

GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. 

JERRY: But an eighty-five? 

ELAINE: Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu... what ever his name was and Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.
 
JERRY: It was a madhouse. 

ELAINE: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again. 

GEORGE: Whoa, forget it. 

ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on. I'll guarantee a one forty. What do you got to lose? 

GEORGE: You could do worse!

ELAINE: No no, come on, I guarantee it. 

GEORGE: Alright, I'll ask her.

ELAINE: Okay, now where I'm going to take it.

JERRY: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.




JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week. 

BABU: You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money. 

JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm. 

BABU: You wish to eat? 

JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works. 

BABU: Very good. 



JERRY: Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great. 










JERRY: You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first eliminating point right there. Anybody goes outside of that circle, yeah you wanna come with us, yeah you're done, the test is over, you went outside the circle okay? 






ELAINE: What are you doing? 

KRAMER: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. 

ELAINE: What's going on? 

MANWANTINGJACKET: Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving until I get the jacket.



MANWANTINGJACKET: Open up Kramer! 

ELAINE: What'd you come in here for? 

KRAMER: I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live. 

ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here. 

KRAMER: I thought you took the test. 

ELAINE: I had to take it again. 

KRAMER: How come? 

ELAINE: What's the difference?!! 

KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now. 

ELAINE: What? 

MANWANTINGJACKET: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back! 

KRAMER: Never! 




MONICA: Come on George, open up. 



MONICA: Well? 



GEORGE: How are you doing? 

MONICA: Where's the test? 

GEORGE: You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...




JERRY: Babu? Babu.



JERRY: Babu... you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken? 

BABU: The shrimp is stringy? 

JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator... 

BABU: Quiet!!

JERRY: No I...

BABU: You shut up! You make me change restaurant, but nobody comes! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people! 

JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check. 

BABU: You bad man! You very very bad man!





JERRY: Bad man? Could my mother been wrong? 




MONICA: Are you looking for George? 

ELAINE: Well uh, kind of.

MONICA: George left. 

ELAINE: Oh. 

MONICA: Is that the test? 

ELAINE: Oh, this? Um... yeah... here you go. 

MONICA: Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better this time. 

ELAINE: Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't really...



ELAINE: ...concentrate. 






JERRY: You know what it was, bad location. 

GEORGE: Lets not stand here, we might run into her. 

JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket? 

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. 

KRAMER: I'm going upstairs. 



ELAINE: Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? One fifty-one. 

JERRY: One fifty-one? 

GEORGE: That's a good score. 

JERRY: So, what are you up for? How about Mexican? 

GEORGE: Italian. 

ELAINE: No, Chinese. 

JERRY: You know what would be great? 






JERRY: It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional good deed doers. Your Lone Rangers, your Superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elastic man. They are all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm renting here, they've got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"
