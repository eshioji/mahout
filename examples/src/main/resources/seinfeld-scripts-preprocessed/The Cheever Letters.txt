



JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?

GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.

JERRY: "We're?" What do you mean, "we're?"

GEORGE: Susan wants me to be there.

JERRY: You're meeting the father for the first time?

GEORGE: Yeah.



JERRY: Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.

GEORGE: I didn't burn it down, Kramer did!



JERRY: I mean the whole thing is ironic. Think of it. Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars....

GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.

JERRY: No, but wait, wait. And then you dump them off onto Kramer...

GEORGE: I know.

JERRY: ...who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! It's very comical.

GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.

JERRY: No no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.

GEORGE: I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what, what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down.

JERRY: Come on. It's not even a house. It's like a cabin.

GEORGE: We could build a cabin like that.



JERRY: Well, maybe not us, but two men could.

GEORGE: Bics? What did you get Bics?

JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?

GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.

JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work.



JERRY: NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act One, Scene A.

GEORGE: So, you're gonna sit there?

JERRY: Just, just park yourself.



JERRY: Alright. Act One, Scene A.

GEORGE: Drink?

JERRY: No, no thank you.

GEORGE: Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Act One, Scene A.



GEORGE: Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?



JERRY: Yes.



JERRY: Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, hi Sandra. Uh yeah, I can hold. Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for like, twenty minutes. Oh, hi Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. I'll be off in a minute! Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks!



JERRY: Are you thinking of ideas?



JERRY: Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for like, twenty minutes. So we're on for later?



ELAINE: Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happening here.



ELAINE: Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.



ELAINE: Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?




JERRY: Okay, let's go.



GEORGE: Alright, here we go. You got it?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: Okay, how about this. I'm in my apartment, you come in.



GEORGE: It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?






ELAINE: Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?

SANDRA: Why? Did Jerry say something?

ELAINE: No no.

SANDRA: He must have said something.

ELAINE: Oh no, he didn't say anything.



SANDRA: I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving.



ELAINE: No Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!




GEORGE: Alright, let's go.

JERRY: Here we go.



KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Yeah Kramer, we're uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work.

JERRY: Yeah, come on.



JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: No more golf.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yeah well, I lost them all in the fire!



KRAMER: Hey George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?

GEORGE: What are you, crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!

KRAMER: Why? What's one thing got to do with another?

GEORGE: Kramer please.

KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.

KRAMER: Where? They're Cubans.



GEORGE: You know what? Maybe I should take off.

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner and, you know, I want to shower first and I want to leave myself plenty of time.



JERRY: You got four hours! What about the script?

GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it.








MRSROSS: Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?

MRROSS: A slight resemblance.



MRSROSS: Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

GEORGE: Oh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean to dedicate yourself to the foot you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean...



MRROSS: How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?

GEORGE: Oh uh, the cigars.



GEORGE: I'm uh, sucking them down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

MRROSS: You know those cigars are made special for Castro?

GEORGE: I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.



MRROSS: What?

SUSAN: He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.

MRROSS: I didn't care much for his jokes.

SUSAN: Daddy never laughs.

GEORGE: Oh well, so what? Laughter, what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha ha!"? What is that? "Ha ha!"

MRROSS: You know you can't get those cigars anywhere.

MRSROSS: You and your cigars.

MRROSS: Wear some more lipstick.

SUSAN: Daddy, there's um, there's something that we have to talk to you about.

MRROSS: Oh, I forgot to ask you, how'd you like the cabin?

GEORGE: Oh, the uh, the cabin... well...






JERRY: Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!

ELAINE: I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?

JERRY: Oh, dial the number.



JERRY: How could you do this?



ELAINE: I was just trying to help you.

JERRY: Oh, just trying to...



JERRY: ...help me. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld.



JERRY: Listen, I, I just want to tell you...



JERRY: ...there's been a terrible misunderstanding. See, I told Elaine that uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, because I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant, "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." You know, but I was really being sincere. No, of course I like you. Tonight? Um, uh, hold on a second.



JERRY: Now she wants to have a drink with me.



JERRY: Yeah, I think I can. Um... yeah, I know where that is. Okay. Uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye.



JERRY: Now I gotta have a drink with her.






GEORGE: The cabin...



GEORGE: Well...


GEORGE: Susan?

SUSAN: Uh... about the cabin...

MRROSS: I love that place. My father built that cabin in nineteen forty-seven. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away ten years later to the day. His last words to me were...



MRROSS: "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin."



MRROSS: And I have for forty-five years. It's often been a sanctuary for me.

GEORGE: Kind of like Superman's fortress of solitude.

MRROSS: What?

GEORGE: Uh, Superman. He uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole to uh, you know, sort of get away from it all.

MRROSS: When I go, I'm passing it on to her.



MRSROSS: I'll take a hotel any day.

SUSAN: Daddy?

MRROSS: Yes?

SUSAN: Daddy, about the cabin.



MRSROSS: Look Henry, I spilled wine on me!



MRROSS: What about it?

SUSAN: Well, the thing is...

MRROSS: What? What is it?

SUSAN: Well, the, the cabin is, kind of, uh... George?

GEORGE: Burned.

MRROSS: Burned?

SUSAN: There was a fire and it uh...

GEORGE: Burned.

MRROSS: The cabin burned?

GEORGE: Yeah, burned. Whoa...



MRSROSS: Burned!



MRROSS: Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?

SUSAN: No. Nothing.



MRSROSS: Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.



GEORGE: Uh, but you know, Mr. Ross, if, if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars and everything, it's really rather ironic. One might even say, in a sense, comical.



GEORGE: Really. Think about it.






SANDRA: I can't believe you said that!

JERRY: What?!

SANDRA: How could you say something like that to me?!

JERRY: What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!

SANDRA: That was a weird thing to say.

JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

SANDRA: Oh, I think you're really sick.

JERRY: I'm not sick.



JERRY: You, you said much sicker things than me.

SANDRA: I'm leaving.



JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.

SANDRA: Excuse me.



JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.

SANDRA: That's okay.

JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us and that'll be the end of it.

SANDRA: Oh, really?



JERRY: I mean, people, they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.






JERRY: So we're uh, drinking and talking and uh, so she starts rubbing my leg.

GEORGE: Whoa! What did you do?

JERRY: Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"

GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?

JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.

GEORGE: Alright, so go ahead.

JERRY: So we go back to my apartment.

GEORGE: Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY: So we're uh, fooling around there you know, it's getting a little passionate... 



JERRY: ...and uh, she starts with the dirty talking.



GEORGE: Alright, alright, hold on! Time out! Whoa, whoa!



GEORGE: What did she say?

JERRY: Oh you know, the usual.

GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?

JERRY: Typical things.



GEORGE: What typical? Give me typical. Give me some typical.

JERRY: She says, uh...



GEORGE: That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.

JERRY: And then she starts talking about her panties.



GEORGE: Gonna need some water here!

JERRY: So I said something.

GEORGE: Okay, what did you say?

JERRY: Now bear in mind I am just trying to keep up.

GEORGE: Of course.

JERRY: Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so uh, so I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"



GEORGE: "The panties your mother laid out for you"? What does that mean?



JERRY: I don't know! It just popped out.

GEORGE: Well, how did she react?

JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.

GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.

GEORGE: Well, what if this girl says something?

JERRY: She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it, how stupid was that? Hey, so Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.

JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.

GEORGE: Huh. Come on, let's go. We got a lot of work to do today.

JERRY: Alright, big work day.

GEORGE: That's right.






GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Let's go.

GEORGE: Here we are.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Let's do it.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: Okay.

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: What do you got?

JERRY: I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go "Hello." Now we need something here.



KRAMER: Oh hey.



KRAMER: Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back.


KRAMER: No, you guys should get back to work.



GEORGE: Don't be silly.

JERRY: Come in, we're taking a break.



KRAMER: Oh yeah?

JERRY: Yeah!

KRAMER: Uh George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?

GEORGE: No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.

KRAMER: Okay well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? Alright, I'll see you guys.








KRAMER: Buenos dias.

CUBANSECRETARY: Buenos dias.

KRAMER: Uh, habla ingles?

CUBANSECRETARY: Si.

KRAMER: Giddy up. Okay, uh...



KRAMER: Um, I need to talk to someone.

CUBANSECRETARY: What is this about?

KRAMER: Uh well, it�s a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.

CUBANSECRETARY: Are you an American?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.

CUBANSECRETARY: I see, excuse me.



KRAMER: Okay.






JERRY: Alright, let's get going. Come on, come on now. Come on, let's get it together. Yeah?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while.

JERRY: Yeah we should.

GEORGE: Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross's apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?

JERRY: Yeah. What, what, does she live with them?

GEORGE: No no no no.

JERRY: Oh.



ELAINE: Hey, nice going Jerome Seinfeld!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.

JERRY: Well, then you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it, there's no two ways about it.

ELAINE: Why? What happened? Did you talk?

JERRY: Talk? Did I talk? You're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Really? You really think I should fire her?

JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script I'd do it myself.












KRAMER: Buenos dias.

LOUIS: What is your name, Senior?

KRAMER: Uh, Kramer.

LOUIS: So, Senior Kramer, what is this about?



KRAMER: Cigars.

LOUIS: Cigars?

KRAMER: Cigars.

LOUIS: What about cigars?

KRAMER: Uh, see here, I...



KRAMER: ...I saved one of the cigar rings.

LOUIS: Oh.



LOUIS: You mean one of these?



KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. That, that's uh, okay. So uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?



LOUIS: You do realize of course these are illegal in your country.

KRAMER: Um, what? Oh, illegal, huh?



LOUIS: I like that jacket.






SUSAN: Hi!

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?



SUSAN: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.

SUSAN: I thought you two guys were working today.

JERRY: Ah, just taking a little break.

GEORGE: Yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses.



SUSAN: Okay, thanks. Come on in for a second.



SUSAN: This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.

GEORGE: Oh, hey there young fellow.



GEORGE: What's your major?

RICKY: I don't have one.

GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry.


GEORGE: There's nothing wrong with the feet.



SUSAN: And this is my Aunt Sara.

SARA: He doesn't look like me.

MRSROSS: Sara, what do you have on your wheels?

SARA: Nothing, they're clean.

MRSROSS: Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

RICKY: Yes.

MRSROSS: Well they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy. 


MRSROSS: When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.



SUSAN: Excuse me.



SUSAN: Hello Raymond.

RAYMOND: Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.

SUSAN: Oh, thank you.



SUSAN: Wow, I've never seen this before.



SUSAN: Oh, they're letters.



SUSAN: Here.

GEORGE: Oh sure.



SUSAN: From...



SUSAN: From John Cheever.

JERRY: Oh, wow.

GEORGE: Oh, wow.

SUSAN: "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my... orgasm...



SUSAN: ...has left me a cripple. I don't how I shall ever get back to work."



SUSAN: "I love you madly, John."



SUSAN: "P.S., loved the cabin."





GEORGE: Well, we... we, we ah...



JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: We really should be uh, heading out.

JERRY: Yeah.



JERRY: Look at the time.

GEORGE: You know, the time.



MRROSS: The box!



MRROSS: My letters! Give me that!



MRROSS: Who told you to open this?!

MRSROSS: Who's John?! Who's John?!

SARA: I knew it!

MRSROSS: I want to know who John is!

RICKY: John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!

MRROSS: Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I loved him deeply! In a way you could never understand.



GEORGE: Well, we really should be..

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.

JERRY: Yeah, and...



JERRY: ...because of the...



JERRY: ...time.

GEORGE: Yeah, time is what he's indicating there.

JERRY: We'll see you.

GEORGE: Uh, anyway, onward and upward.








GEORGE: Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Alright, let's go.

GEORGE: Come on now.

JERRY: Right now.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: You and me.

GEORGE: You got it.

JERRY: No fooling.

GEORGE: Okay, so, what do you got?

JERRY: Alright, I got uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".

GEORGE: Alright, so we need something.

JERRY: Yeah. How about this. I say, "How's it going?"

GEORGE: "How's it going?" Beautiful.



GEORGE: Oh come on, we were just on a roll now.

JERRY: Alright, did you get that line?

GEORGE: "How's it going?"

JERRY: Did you write it down?

GEORGE: I'm writing it. "How's it going?"

JERRY: Okay.



ELAINE: Real good!

JERRY: What?!

ELAINE: Do you know how much money you cost me today?! Four hundred and twenty-nine dollars!

JERRY: What?! How?

ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!

JERRY: What calls?!

ELAINE: Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch and Sandra told Lippman!

JERRY: Oh, did she say anything else to you?

ELAINE: "Anything else?" What do you mean "anything else?"

JERRY: So she just left the office, didn't say a word to you about anything?

ELAINE: Yeah!

JERRY: Beautiful.

ELAINE: Why is that beautiful?

JERRY: Oh no, not beautiful.

ELAINE: Its four hundred and twenty-nine dollars!

JERRY: Hey look, I'm going to pay for that.

ELAINE: No no.



JERRY: No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her, the whole thing was all my...

ELAINE: Okay.



JERRY: ...fault.



JERRY: Do you smell smoke?



KRAMER: Oh hey! Hey Jer, I want you to meet my new friends here. This is uh, Louis, Jorge and Umberto.

JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.

KRAMER: Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester, gonna hit the links.

JERRY: Oh.



JERRY: Isn't that uh, your...



KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, okay, we're going. Vamoose muchachos!



ELAINE: Hey, what are you reading?

GEORGE: Oh uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.

ELAINE: John Cheever? You ever read any of his stuff?

JERRY: Uh yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing.



JERRY: Alright.



JERRY: Look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.

ELAINE: Okay, I'll leave you two alone.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties...



ELAINE: ...and they're all laid out for me.
