

JERRY: ...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer. There's always a small problem. "There'll be a slight delay. We'll be a little late. If you could be a little patient! We're just trying to get one of those little trucks to pull us up just a little closer to the jet way so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!"




JERRY: Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you shut up?

ELAINE: Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.

JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothing ever works. The window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work and it smells like a cheap hooker. Or is that you?

ELAINE: Give me ten bucks and find out.

JERRY: So, this worked out pretty good. Them giving me an extra ticket you know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister.

ELAINE: Yeah, worked out good.

JERRY: And here's the beauty.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: George is picking us up at the airport.

ELAINE: Get out of here! Why?

JERRY: You know that awning outside my building?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.

ELAINE: So what happened?

JERRY: He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's waving at it. So I told him if he picks us up at the airport he wouldn't have to pay me anything.

ELAINE: Hey, how we doing on time?

JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane.




ELAINE: Hey! Wait up!

JERRY: Hey! Wait up!

SHUTTLEBUSDRIVER: Sorry.








SKYCAP: Where you going?

JERRY: Uh, JFK.  I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?

ELAINE: Yeah, you want five?

JERRY: Give me ten.

ELAINE: You're giving him ten dollars?

JERRY: Well, we got three bags.

ELAINE: That's a pretty big tip.

JERRY: That's what they get!

ELAINE: They don't get that much.

JERRY: Let's ask him.

ELAINE: We can't ask him.

JERRY: Let's see what he says.

ELAINE: Jerry, we don't have time for this.

JERRY: Two seconds.  Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.

SKYCAP: Depends on the person, depends on the bag.

JERRY: Uh, how about a couple of people like us?

SKYCAP: People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing.

JERRY: Come on, seriously...

SKYCAP: Well, since you asked, usually I get five dollars a bag.

ELAINE: What!?

SKYCAP: That's right.

ELAINE: Five dollars a bag? I don't think so.

SKYCAP: Look, you asked, I told you.

ELAINE: You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us.

JERRY: Alright look, we're late. Thank you very much.

ELAINE: You're lucky I don't report you.



SKYCAP: JFK.



SKYCAP: Honolulu.




ELAINE: Wait up!

JERRY: You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. Because a girl runs like a girl, with the little steps and the arms flailing out. You wanna make this plane you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!






JERRY: The flight's been canceled?!

AIRLINETICKETLADY: Everything into JFK is booked. No wait, I have two seats into LaGuardia but they're not together. It's boarding right now.

JERRY: We'll take them!

ELAINE: We're not going to sit together?

JERRY: Well, so what? It's not that long, you'll read.

ELAINE: Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.

JERRY: We'll call him.

ELAINE: There's no time.

JERRY: No time? Is there time?

AIRLINETICKETLADY: There's no time.

JERRY: There's no time. Alright, we'll call him from the plane.

AIRLINETICKETLADY: I have one seat in first class and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.



JERRY: I'll take the first class.

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Why should you get the first class?

JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Alright then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class Elaine. I can't go back to coach. I can't. I won't.

ELAINE: You flew here coach.

JERRY: Yeah, that's a point.

ELAINE: Alright fine, I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die anyway.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.




AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Third row right.



AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.

JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey!



AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: Oh, excuse me. Um, excuse me miss? I think you're sitting in my seat.



AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: I never check my bags. I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.

ELAINE: Great...  Help me...






TIA: Excuse me, I think you're in my seat.

JERRY: Oh, sorry, my mistake.  Thank you!




GEORGE: Hey, thanks for coming with me.

KRAMER: Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?

GEORGE: I confused it with another awning.

KRAMER: So how we doing on time?

GEORGE: We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal exactly seventeen minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking out of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.



GEORGE: What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!

KRAMER: Will you relax?!

GEORGE: Oh, I had it perfectly timed out. The Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!

KRAMER: This is the best way to go!

GEORGE: Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my fifty bucks.

KRAMER: George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on man.

GEORGE: Really?

KRAMER: If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.

GEORGE: The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?

KRAMER: Duty.

GEORGE: Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?

KRAMER: No, I don't know how much duty is.

GEORGE: Duty is nothing. It's like sales tax.

KRAMER: I still like to stop at the duty free shop.

GEORGE: I like to stop at the duty free shop.



GEORGE: I like to stop at the duty free shop! I like to stop at the duty free shop!

KRAMER: I like to stop at the duty free shop! I like to stop at the duty free shop!




TIA: So he says, "squeeze your breasts together", and I say, "I thought this was an ad for shoes."

JERRY: Oh my.

TIA: Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page one forty-six.

JERRY: Wow! Coming out of the shower. It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up. What is this an ad for?

TIA: See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background out of focus?

JERRY: Uh huh.




KRAMER: How does it look on your side?



KRAMER: We'll get there.




ELAINE:  Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum, that's helpful.




GEORGE: They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!

KRAMER: Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!




GEORGE: Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.

KRAMER: No, there it is, right there. One thirty-three and it's canceled.

GEORGE: Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!

KRAMER: Okay come on, let's go check over at the ticket counter.



GROSSBARD: Oh, there it is honey, gate eighteen A, eight-thirty.



KRAMER: Did you see that guy?

GEORGE: No. What guy?

KRAMER: That guy, he was just...

GEORGE: Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to a blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!

KRAMER: I know that guy.




AIRLINEPRISONER: Gotta get my Time magazine. Never miss my Time magazine.

FBIMAN: Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.



AIRLINEPRISONER: Hey, I was gonna take that!

GEORGE: Gee, I'm sorry, I got here first.

AIRLINEPRISONER: I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine.

GEORGE: You don't understand, there's a blurb about me in this magazine!

AIRLINEPRISONER: A blurb?! You're a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!

FBIMAN: Alright, let's go.



AIRLINEPRISONER: I want the magazine!

GEORGE: Um... no.

AIRLINEPRISONER: You know what I would do to you if I wasn't in these shackles?



GEORGE: But you are Blanche, you are in the shackles! Oh, I can't wait to read my Time magazine! Last copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow in the park! It's supposed to be a beautiful  day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!



KRAMER: They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour only at LaGuardia.

GEORGE: LaGuardia? Alright, let's go. Come on.

KRAMER: Where do I know that guy from?




ELAINE:  Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom.






JERRY: Oh my, that is refreshing.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Would you care for some slippers?

JERRY: Sounds lovely!  May I?

TIA: Please!

JERRY: Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.






GEORGE: My name is not mentioned in this blurb.

KRAMER: It's Grossbard!

GEORGE: Who's Grossbard?

KRAMER: When I lived on Third avenue and eighteenth street twenty years ago I had this roommate who was always behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent, two hundred and forty bucks! He took the cash and disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh huh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy, John Grossbard!

GEORGE: Hey Kramer, come on, it was two hundred and forty bucks twenty years ago.

KRAMER: No, I'm gonna turn around. I'm gonna get that guy.

GEORGE: No no no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You cannot abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.







JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: They're gardenias, mostly.

JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Yes, there are a few of those too.

TIA: It's almost overwhelming.






ELAINE: What'd he say? What'd he say?




GEORGE: Well, You're not gonna believe it.

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: The plane's been re-routed back to Kennedy. We've got forty-five minutes.

KRAMER: Let's go. Listen to the bell Grossbard, it tolls for thee.






AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: We have some delicious Chateau Briande, my personal favorite. Or if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a hint of saffron.

JERRY: Oh, saffron! That sounds good.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: And today we're featuring wines from the Tuscany region.

JERRY: Tuscany!

TIA: Tuscany!






ELAINE: Hi. Can I get to my seat?

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: You're just gonna have to wait.

ELAINE: But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy.

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.

ELAINE: Well, nobody told me that!

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: Look, this plane is full. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please, you're just gonna have to wait.




GEORGE: There it is. Gate forty-six. We got plenty of time.

KRAMER: Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I still got time to catch him!

GEORGE: How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.

KRAMER: Give me your credit card.

GEORGE: My credit card?

KRAMER: Just give me the card, don't ask me any questions.

GEORGE: I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!

KRAMER: I'm gonna buy a ticket. I'm gonna get on that flight.

GEORGE: What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.

KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now give me the card.

GEORGE: This is a great idea! Here use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase. Wait! Get two tickets. As long as you�re turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get double the bonus miles.




ELAINE: Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart.

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.

ELAINE: I'll try and remember that. Where's my meal?

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: He asked me where you were and you were gone so long I thought you uh, switched seats.

ELAINE: Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: Are you sure?

ELAINE: Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.

ELAINE: Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it or something.

AIRLINEPASSENGERTWO: No no, it all has to do with the way they kill the pig.

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: They don't eat pigs!

AIRLINEPASSENGERTWO: They do if it's killed right under a Rabbi's supervision.

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: Oh, You know what? I ordered the kosher meal.

ELAINE: Then why didn't you take it?

AIRLINEPASSENGERONE: I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.

ELAINE: You're eating my food!

AIRLINEATTENDANTTWO: Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it or not?




JERRY: Mmm!

TIA: Mmm!

TIA: This is the best sundae I've ever had.

JERRY: Oh man, you know what? They got the fudge on the bottom you see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eating your ice cream.

TIA: I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.

JERRY: Thank you.

JERRY: Mmm!

TIA: Mmm!







AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: More anything?

JERRY: More everything!




KRAMER: Look, I got super savers! Come on.

GEORGE: Super savers? Are they refundable!? You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!

KRAMER: She talked me in to it. She said it was the best deal.

GEORGE: Do you know how much this is going to cost me?

KRAMER: Look, I'll tell you what, I'll split it with you

GEORGE: Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.






KRAMER: Hey, remember me?

GROSSBARD: Pardon?

KRAMER: Twenty years ago? Remember? You owe me some money. Now give me your wallet.

GROSSBARD: I'm not going to give you my wallet.






AIRLINEPRISONER: Just a minute.



GEORGE: Whoa!




AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Excuse me... Excuse me...

ELAINE: What? Oh no, nothing for me thanks.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: What is your name?

ELAINE: Elaine Benes?



AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: You're going to have to go back to coach.

ELAINE: No, but there was nobody sitting here.

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.

ELAINE: Oh no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there.



ELAINE: Oh, you got cookies!

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: You're going to have to go back to your seat!

ELAINE: Okay, fine. I'll go back. You know, our goal should be a society without classes!



ELAINE: Do you realize that the people up here are getting cookies!



JERRY: What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with.  What is going on?

AIRLINEATTENDANTONE: Sir, this woman tried to sneak into first class.

JERRY: Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is that curtain is no security, there really should be a locking door.






KRAMER: Hey! That guy owes me two hundred and forty bucks!






JERRY: Couldn't be.




JERRY: Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere. I got my bags, I'm ready to go.

ELAINE: Yeah, you got your bags.





ELAINE: The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.

JERRY: Yeah, me too.



TIA: I'll call you.

JERRY: Okay.  It's a business thing.



KRAMER: You guys ready?

JERRY: Yeah. Where's George?




GEORGE: Kramer!




JERRY: But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes right on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. But uh, the worst way of flying I think is "standby", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby; you end up standing there going, "Bye!" So I was on this plane where the flight attendant, it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really makes a big difference. I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going, "Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?" It�s like, "Who the Hell are you?!" "Well, I'm the flight attendant." "Well, I'm the pilot, alright, so why don't you sit down I'm about to bring her in."
