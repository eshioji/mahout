

JERRY: Have you ever called someone up and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine. You know and you're always kind of thrown off.



JERRY: You go, "Oh, I uh, I, I didn't know you were there. I uh, just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you." So here what we have is two people who hate each other, don't really ever want to talk, but the phone machine is like this relationship respirator keeping these marginal brain dead relationships alive. And we all do it. Why? So that when we come home, you can see that little flashing red light. You go, "Alright, messages." You see, people need that. It's very important for human beings to feel they are popular and well liked amongst a large group of people that we don't care for.






JERRY: Well this is it.

NAOMI: Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.

JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.

NAOMI: Yeah, me too.

JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.



NAOMI: Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?

JERRY: No. I mean, I don't think so.

NAOMI: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.

JERRY: No no no, I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.



JERRY: That's not funny Naomi.



JERRY: I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.



GEORGE: Jerry, its George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.



GEORGE: Alright, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?



GEORGE: Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...



JERRY: This thing has never worked right.



NAOMI: You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?

JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit, ha ha ha ha ha" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways...



JERRY: It makes the juice, it extracts the, the pulp and, and, and the vitamins for, for long life and, and, and vitality.




JERRY: How could you leave a message like that on my machine?

GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?

JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!

GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.

JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.

GEORGE: What do you mean not going? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.

JERRY: Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel going out with a fish monger. You know, because she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.

GEORGE: Well maybe you should ask Elaine.

JERRY: Yeah, but if I ask Elaine then Kramer will feel slighted.

GEORGE: Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.

JERRY: Yeah, wait a minute do you smell smoke?



KRAMER: Hmm.

JERRY: Ah, Kramer.



KRAMER: Hello boys, top of the morning to you. What do you say? What do you be?

JERRY: Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.

KRAMER: So, what are you guys doing this weekend?

JERRY: Uh, we're uh...

GEORGE: Uh uh, we're uh...

KRAMER: Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester Country Club, mmm.

JERRY: Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on forty-ninth street. I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round. Then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Isn't that beautiful?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Yeah, huh, um yeah.

KRAMER: Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.



GEORGE: Gee, that's, that's too bad.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

KRAMER: Why? What what?

GEORGE: Well, because we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But uh, alright, well.

KRAMER: Well what, they got any golf courses up there?

JERRY: No no no.

GEORGE: No no no no no, that's ah, that's pie country.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Yeah, they uh, they do a lot of baking up there.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

JERRY: They sell them by the side of the road.  Blueberry, blackberry...

GEORGE: Blackberry, boysenberry...

JERRY: Boysenberry, huckleberry...

GEORGE: Huckleberry, raspberry...

JERRY: Raspberry, strawberry...

GEORGE: Strawberry, cranberry...

JERRY: Peach.




ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.

ELAINE: What's that?

JERRY: Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doing this.

ELAINE: "I'm very impressed?" Ah, you mean pressed because its like a dry cleaner?

JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So come on, you going to go?

ELAINE: Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!

JERRY: Well, um same bed.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: And uh, underwear and a t-shirt.

ELAINE: What about me?

JERRY: Well you'd be naked of course.

ELAINE: Uh, that's...

MEL: Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?

JERRY: Yeah.

MEL: My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger.

JERRY: Hi.

MEL: I drive that truck out there.

JERRY: Oh, the Yoo Hoo?

MEL: Yeah.

JERRY: I love Yoo Hoo.

MEL: Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood, the damndest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.

JERRY: A bubble?

ELAINE: A bubble?

MEL: Yes, a bubble!

MEL: Do you mind? May I?

ELAINE: Oh, sure.



MEL: Ah, It'd break your heart seeing him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends, just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week hauling Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little... bubble boy.



MEL: Excuse me, I ah...

ELAINE: Oh right here.





MEL: Excuse me, anyway we were watching you on TV.

JERRY: You get in the bubble with him?

MEL: No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.

JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.

MEL: No, it's clear.

JERRY: Ah ha.

ELAINE: Who has the remote?



MEL: He does.

ELAINE: The remote goes through the bubble?

MEL: Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote.

JERRY: So you have no control over the remote?

MEL: No, it's frustrating.

JERRY: Mmm.

ELAINE: Yeah, of course, yeah.



MEL: So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.

JERRY: Aw, that's nice!

MEL: Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart to pay him a visit and just say hello.

JERRY: Huh, well, tomorrow I...

ELAINE: Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.

JERRY: Yeah uh, okay uh, tomorrow uh, where do you, where do you live uh, up town? Upper west side?

MEL: No, up state.

JERRY: Up state! Hmm.




JERRY: He's a bubble boy.

GEORGE: A bubble boy?

JERRY: Yes. A bubble boy.

SUSAN: What's a bubble boy?

JERRY: He lives in a bubble.

GEORGE: Boy!

SUSAN: Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?

JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.

SUSAN: Oh.

GEORGE: What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?

JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do? I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.

SUSAN: Well, where does he live?

JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, something.

SUSAN: Wait a minute, this is right on the way to the cabin.

GEORGE: Well alright, beautiful, so you stop in, you, you visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.

JERRY: You think we can do it?

SUSAN: Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.

JERRY: Oh, great. Okay we're going away. I think I'm excited.



SUSAN: I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in nineteen forty-seven. It's incredible.

JERRY: Oh.

GEORGE: Alright there you go. It's a forty-seven cabin alright. So, we'll see you tomorrow.

JERRY: Okay.



KRAMER: Well.

GEORGE: Very nice.

JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.



KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.



SUSAN: The what?

GEORGE: Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on.

SUSAN: Did you?



GEORGE: No no no, we'll talk about it later.

SUSAN: Is that one of the cigars my father gave you?








ELAINE: Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?

JERRY: Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.

ELAINE: Oh, that's nice!

JERRY: What's he doing? What is his hurry?



ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.

JERRY: I know he once went from West eighty-first street to Kennedy Airport in twenty-five minutes. I, I never heard the end of it.



JERRY: Look at him.




GEORGE: Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?

SUSAN: Why?

GEORGE:  Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West eighty-first street in uh, in fifteen minutes. Uh huh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.




JERRY: What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?

ELAINE: Isn't that blue car him?

JERRY: No no, that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot! Now what are we going to do!?

ELAINE: It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.

JERRY: I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I, I don't even remember the name of the town.

ELAINE: What? You don't have the directions?

JERRY: No, I was following him.

ELAINE: How could you not take the directions?

JERRY: Because he's my directions.




SUSAN: I didn't see them George.




JERRY: We make all these plans, this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour, the whole weekend's over, incredible, just like that.

ELAINE: Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.

JERRY: I don't know what to do! I don't know where I am!

ELAINE: Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure something out.




SUSAN: We lost them. Do you know that? We lost them!

GEORGE: Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?

SUSAN: Well now what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.

SUSAN: Does he have the address?






JERRY: Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.

NAOMI: Hi, Jerry it's Naomi. Ah, listen, if its not too late I changed my mind. I'd like to go to the cabin.

KRAMER: Wait wait, yeah.



KRAMER: Hello! Hi, uh, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Uh, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, but listen, uh, see uh, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinking of going up myself. They got pies and uh, I got the directions right here.




KRAMER: So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament going on. Do you mind if I smoke?

NAOMI: No.

KRAMER: These are Cubans.






 



GEORGE: I don't know if this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.



GEORGE: Would you stop it.



GEORGE: Would you quit it please? Someone is going to see us here.

SUSAN: So what? You are such a prude.

GEORGE: Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them.



SUSAN: Okay, come on, let�s go in.

GEORGE: What?

SUSAN: Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.

GEORGE: I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.

SUSAN: What's the matter?

GEORGE: I, I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting better and then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. Boom. That was the end of it.

SUSAN: Okay, we're going in. Come on.

GEORGE: Susan, wait please.



GEORGE: Please.

SUSAN: Come on George. George stop. George.

GEORGE: Susan, Susan would you wait.




JERRY: I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast and my whole weekend is gone, the plans, the packing, everything.

ELAINE: Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?

JERRY: Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy? You don't have to mention the bubble boy?  I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?



JERRY: I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.

WAITRESS: How about you?

ELAINE: Um, I'll just have a glass of water.



JERRY: You can't just have water.

ELAINE: Why not? That's all I want.

JERRY: Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.



WAITRESS: Hold it a second. Don't you play on TV?

JERRY: Oh, no.

ELAINE: Yes! Yes. You saw him on TV.

WAITRESS: What's your name?

ELAINE: Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY: Elaine.

WAITRESS: Garry Seinfeld! I saw you on the Tonight Show.

ELAINE: Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?

WAITRESS: Oh, ha ha.

JERRY: Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.

ELAINE: He's lying. They're in the trunk.



ELAINE: Now you get to sign another one.

JERRY: I'm not lying.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah he is.



JERRY: She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.




MRSSANGER: See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider.

GEORGE: Huh.





GEORGE: Can you uh, go in the bubble?

MRSSANGER: Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.

MEL: The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.

GEORGE: So then he makes his own bed?

MRSSANGER: Well, that's one of the things we fight about.



MEL: Would you like to meet him?

GEORGE: Uh, well, you know...

MRSSANGER: Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.

BUBBLEBOY: Hey Ma! What the hell do I got to do to get some food around here? I'm starving! And if its peanut butter, I'm gonna shove it in your face!






ELAINE: One picture left in the trunk.

JERRY: Uh, thanks! This is fun! Yeah, this turned out to be a great weekend.

ELAINE: Where's my water?

JERRY: Oh, it's coming. Here you go.

WAITRESS: Thanks.

ELAINE: What did you write?

WAITRESS: "Nothing's finer than being in your diner."

ELAINE: "There's, there is nothing finer than being in your diner?"

JERRY: No good?

ELAINE: This is what you came up with?

JERRY: Well.

ELAINE: That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.

JERRY: Yeah yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.

WAITRESS: Why?

JERRY: I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.

WAITRESS: It's good. I like it.

JERRY: No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.

WAITRESS: Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.

JERRY: No look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.

WAITRESS: Right!






MRSSANGER: This is Donald.

GEORGE: Hi.



SUSAN: Hello.

BUBBLEBOY: Who are you? Where's Seinfeld?

MRSSANGER: He's on his way. These are his friends.

BUBBLEBOY: What are you looking at? Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

GEORGE: Of course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also... bubble... you know.  I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.

BUBBLEBOY: What's your story?

SUSAN: I, I, I have no story.

GEORGE: She works for NBC.

BUBBLEBOY: How about taking your top off?

MRSSANGER: Donald, behave yourself!

BUBBLEBOY: Come on!

MRSSANGER: I know. I know. Why don't you play a game of Trivial Pursuit?

GEORGE: Ah, well, you know we gotta be running because of the...

BUBBLEBOY: Oh, what are you, afraid?

GEORGE: Ah no, uh, it's just that...

BUBBLEBOY: Well I'm going to kick your ass.




JERRY: Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.

WAITRESS: You are really starting to get under my skin.

JERRY: I want that picture.

WAITRESS: Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.



JERRY: I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.

WAITRESS: Well, you ain't getting it back.

JERRY: Well, maybe I'll just take it back.



ELAINE: This chicken is really good.




BUBBLEBOY: Okay, history. This is for the game. How are you doing over there? Not to good!

GEORGE: Alright Bubble Boy. Let's just play. Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?

BUBBLEBOY: That's a joke. The Moors.

GEORGE: Oh no, I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is, the Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: Moops? Let me see that.



BUBBLEBOY: That's not Moops you jerk, it's Moors. It's a misprint.

GEORGE: I'm sorry, the card says Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: It doesn't matter, it's Moors. There's no Moops.

GEORGE: It's Moops.

BUBBLEBOY: Moors.

GEORGE: Moops!

BUBBLEBOY: Moors!




KRAMER: Hey! Anybody home? Oh boy.

NAOMI: What should we do?

KRAMER: Ah, hold these pies.



KRAMER: Okay.






GEORGE: Help, someone!



BUBBLEBOY: There's no Moops you idiot!

SUSAN: Stop it! Let go of him!

MRSSANGER: Donald, stop it! Now, let go of him Donald. Donald!

BUBBLEBOY: I'm going to kill him!

GEORGE: You're choking me!

MRSSANGER: Donald... Donald...

BUBBLEBOY: Moors! Say Moors!

GEORGE: Moops! Moops!

MRSSANGER: Donald, no! Donald, stop it!










JERRY: What are you doing? You're choking me! Elaine!

WAITRESS: Are you going to pay for that?

JERRY: No, I want the picture back!



VERN: Something's happened to the Bubble Boy. They're rushing him to the hospital!

WAITRESS: What?



JERRY: The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?

VERN: That's his house right down the road.

PAGE: He got in a fight with some guy.

PRESTON: What kind of person would hurt the Bubble Boy?

VERN: Some little bald guy from the city.

PAGE: Come on Vern, Preston, don't you think we ought to do something?






KRAMER: Naomi, come on let's get going.



NAOMI: But that lake must be freezing.



KRAMER: Nah, it's good for you. Retards the aging process.



NAOMI: Ready to go swimming?

KRAMER: Let's go, okay.



KRAMER: Gotcha.


 







GEORGE: Jerry! What happened to you?

JERRY: What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.

GEORGE: Oh I was not. The Bubble Boy tried to kill me.



ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Yeah, Susan tell him.

SUSAN: It's a long story.

GEORGE: Yeah.



BUBBLEBOY: Hey Seinfeld!

JERRY: Hey, happy birthday.

ELAINE: Hi.

BUBBLEBOY: Thanks for showing up. You know your friends here tried to kill me!

GEORGE: Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't you, you little twerp.

BUBBLEBOY: Moors!

GEORGE: Moops!

BUBBLEBOY: Moors!

GEORGE: Moops!

BUBBLEBOY: Moors!

GEORGE: Moops!



VERN: There's the guy who tried to kill the Bubble Boy! Get him!

GEORGE: Go go, get out...









JERRY: Fire engines?






GEORGE: What? Must be a big one.




ELAINE: Do you smell something?

JERRY: Yeah.

SUSAN: Smoke.

GEORGE: Yeah.



GEORGE: definite smoke.

ELAINE: Ah, look it's a fire!







JERRY: Holy cow! Look at that!

SUSAN: It's my father's cabin!

ELAINE: The cabin is on fire!

GEORGE: Um, I just realized. You never gave me back the change from the tolls.

ELAINE: How could this have happened?





KRAMER: ...It's a big, wild, funky mountain man...

NAOMI: Oh my God, the cabin!?

JERRY: What are you two doing here?

NAOMI: Look at that.



JERRY: You didn't?



KRAMER: My Cubans!






JERRY: Something very scary and exciting about fire, ah people always run to see a fire. They're very proud if they have a fireplace. And I think that's what smoking is really all about. That's the power of smoke it's just this thing.



JERRY: I got fire right here in my hand. Smoke and fire is literally, coming right out of my mouth. And it's very intimidating to the non-smoker because it's like talking to someone that's going my head could open up, lava could explode out, pour right down my face, doesn't bother me a bit. And then a cigar is even worse. I mean a cigar is like, you think this end is bad, look at this wet, disgusting, chewed up nub, huh. How scary is that?
