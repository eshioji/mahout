

JERRY: You can't just have an adultery, you commit adultery. And you can't even commit adultery unless you already have a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But you know some people actually cheat on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, you know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and going, "Alright, give me everything you have too."




GEORGE: You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?



JERRY: Produce section. Very provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling. It just happened.

GEORGE: So when're you gonna see her?

JERRY: Tonight.

GEORGE: What's her name?

JERRY: I... don't... know...

GEORGE: How could you not know her name?

JERRY: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish.



JERRY: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for one day.



GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. You know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

JERRY: Yeah, I did that too.

GEORGE: Yeah, you remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to nineteen hundred dollars. Nineteen hundred dollars! They're sending me a check!

JERRY: Wow!

GEORGE: Huh yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything.

JERRY: You know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.

GEORGE: Really? Who?

JERRY: Nobody you know.

GEORGE: Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse.

JERRY: Why don't you put it in the bank?

GEORGE: Bank? This is found money. I want to parlay it. I wanna make a big score!

JERRY: Oh, you mean you wanna lose it.



KRAMER: Yeah, alright, you got it, eh?

JERRY: Yes I did.

KRAMER: Yes.

GEORGE: What's with the gloves?

KRAMER: Well, I'm staining my floors you know. I don't want to get my hands dirty.

GEORGE: Huh. What, the whole apartment?

KRAMER: The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. Because I need wood around me. Wood, Jerry.



KRAMER: Wood.

JERRY: Wood is good.

KRAMER: Definitely.

JERRY: So we're still going to the health club to play racquetbal right?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.

JERRY: Okay, soon as Elaine gets here.

KRAMER: Yep.



JERRY: What, you rented "Home Alone?"

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: I thought you saw that already.

GEORGE: No, I saw "Home Alone Two."

JERRY: Oh, right... but you hated it!

GEORGE: Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house, I'm doing something.

JERRY: Alright, go ahead.



JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me, are you ready to go?

JERRY: No. Come on up.



KRAMER: I can't work with these!

JERRY: What's wrong?

KRAMER: Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no fine touch.

JERRY: You said "gloves."

KRAMER: No, no, these are too thick. 



KRAMER: Oh, is that "Home Alone?"

GEORGE: Yeah, the original.



ELAINE: Hey Boys O!

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey, how's it going?

ELAINE: Hello.

JERRY: Hey.



ELAINE: Get your stuff, let's get going.



ELAINE: Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Remember Roy, the artist?

JERRY: Oh, the "triangle" guy.

ELAINE: Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.

JERRY: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?

ELAINE: Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, uh just, I don't know a little too...

JERRY: Artsy?

ELAINE: Fat.

JERRY: Oh.

ELAINE: He was a fat, starving artist, you know. That's very rare.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.

JERRY: What's wrong with him?

ELAINE: Uh, something with his spleen.  Anyway it'll just take five minutes, okay, and then the hospital is right on the way.

KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Alright we'll wait for you.

KRAMER: Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yeah.



ELAINE: Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? Could you go into the room with me to visit him because uh, I don't want him to think that I'm, you know... interested.

JERRY: Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.

ELAINE: Well...

JERRY: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.





KRAMER: Alright, lets go.

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Yep yep yep.



ELAINE: What's with him?

JERRY: You know a lot of people have asked that.




ELAINE: Roy!

ROY: Elaine! What a surprise.



ELAINE: Oh my God! I hardly recognize you! You look so...

ROY: Yeah, you know, I've lost some weight.

ELAINE: A lot of weight.

ROY: I know.

ELAINE: You look terrific.

ROY: Thank you. So do you.





ELAINE: Ah, this is uh... you really lost weight.

ROY: Thank you.



JERRY: Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.


 







KRAMER: Oh.





KRAMER: Ah, the mother load!









ELAINE: I can't believe it! You were huge! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you.

ROY: Yes, I remember.

ELAINE: Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.

ROY: Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.

ELAINE: Me?

ROY: After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.

ELAINE: Get out!



ROY: Really, it's the truth.

ELAINE: Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks.

JERRY: Ah, that's terrible.

ELAINE: I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.



ROY: You did.

JERRY: You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep.

ELAINE: Now listen Roy, tell me something. When are you getting out of here?

ROY: Next Thursday.

ELAINE: Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a big meal because you are getting too thin.



JERRY: Honey, aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?

ELAINE: No, that's the week after.

JERRY: No, I believe its next week.

ELAINE: You're wrong.

JERRY: No I'm not.

ELAINE: Shut up.



KRAMER: Pay dirt!



ELAINE: Uh Roy, this is uh, Kramer. He's one of our friends.

ROY: Oh, how do you do?

KRAMER: Yeah, I do great, yeah.



DOCTOR: Hi Roy.

ROY: Oh, hey Dr. Siegel.

JERRY: Hey Doc, check this out.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: I just learned that.

DOCTOR:  Uh huh.



DOCTOR: I just wanted to stop by, see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.

KRAMER: Ah, yeah yeah, I have a, I have a question, um... what do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?

DOCTOR: Are you asking because you saw Twenty Twenty last night?

KRAMER: I sure am.

DOCTOR: Well that report was about one very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.

KRAMER: But you will use a retractor.

DOCTOR: We have to.

KRAMER: Mmm hmm.



DOCTOR: Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?

KRAMER: I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open. His guts will be all over the place.

JERRY: Yeah, that's true.

KRAMER: They'll saw through bone.



KRAMER: You'll see what's inside bone.






JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Hi.

JERRY: What are doing, you crying??

GEORGE: No.



JERRY: You crying from "Home Alone?"

GEORGE: The old man got to me.

JERRY: Alright, just get yourself together. I don't know if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.

GEORGE: Oh shut up! What are you doing back so soon anyway?

JERRY: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.

GEORGE: Oh. How's the guy?

JERRY: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art.

GEORGE: Huh, that's nerve.

JERRY: Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants.

GEORGE: You know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome."  He falls ill, she falls in love.

JERRY: You mean Florence Nightingale.

GEORGE: What'd I say? Clara?

JERRY: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.

GEORGE: Clara Barton? What did she do?

JERRY: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.

GEORGE: Susan B. Anthony, I think I'd have a problem with.

JERRY: Yeah, I think you would.

GEORGE: So, you gonna buy his art?

JERRY: No. Why don't you buy it? You got nineteen hundred dollars.

GEORGE: Yeah, that's what I want, triangles. Alright, I'm out of here. Have fun with what's her name.

JERRY: I will.

GEORGE: You know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.

JERRY: No, it isn't. I can find out.

GEORGE: Yeah? How?

JERRY: There are ways.




JERRY: You know I remember when I was a kid growing up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe. "Jerry Jerry Dingle berry", and uh "Seinsmelled".

DELORES: "Seinsmelled"?

JERRY: Yeah. Uh huh. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?

DELORES: Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?



DELORES: Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.



DELORES: Oh, oh Jerry.

JERRY: Oh... you.




GEORGE: Now let's try breast, Celeste, Kest...

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Rest, Sest, Hest...

JERRY: Hest? That's not a name.

GEORGE: What, you should've just asked her.

JERRY: I know, I should've asked her.

GEORGE: What're you gonna do now?

JERRY: I don't know. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.

GEORGE: Aretha!



JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Bovary!



JERRY: Alright, that's enough.

GEORGE: Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. You know, the, the credit cards, driver's license.

JERRY: How am I gonna do that?

GEORGE: When she goes to the bathroom.



KRAMER: Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?

JERRY: You asked a date to go to the operation?

KRAMER: Yeah, so come on, what do you say?

GEORGE: What kind of operation is it?

KRAMER: Spleenectomy.

GEORGE: Isn't that where they remove the...

KRAMER: No, no, don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah come on, what do you say?

GEORGE: Mulva!



JERRY: Mulva?



KRAMER: Come on, come on. You wanna go? Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah.

JERRY: Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee. Then we'll watch them go slice this fat bastard up.




DOCTOR: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse... retractor.



JERRY: What are you eating?

KRAMER: Junior Mints. Do you want one?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...



KRAMER: Could you get...



KRAMER: Yeah.



JERRY: Where'd you get those?

KRAMER: The machine. You want one?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Here, take one.

JERRY: I don't want one.

KRAMER: No, they're good! Take one.

JERRY: I don't want any!

KRAMER: Just take one.

JERRY: No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!







JERRY: Did it go in?

KRAMER: Uh.
 



JERRY: ...over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing into the patient!

GEORGE: What do you mean "into the patient"?

JERRY: Into the patient, literally!

GEORGE: Into the hole?

JERRY: Yes, the hole!

GEORGE: Didn't they notice it?

JERRY: No!

GEORGE: How could they not notice it?

JERRY: Because it's a little mint. It's a Junior Mint.

GEORGE: What did they do?

JERRY: They sealed him up with the mint inside.

GEORGE: They left the Junior Mint in him?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: I, I guess it can't hurt him. People eat pounds of those things.

JERRY: Yes they eat them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!



JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.



KRAMER: Hey. This wallpaper is very good. My place looks like a ski lodge!

JERRY: Why did you force that mint on me? I told you I didn't want the mint!

KRAMER: Well, I didn't believe you.

JERRY: How could you not believe me?

KRAMER: Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint, it's delicious!

JERRY: That's true.

KRAMER: It's very refreshing!

JERRY: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine.



ELAINE: Prognosis... negative.

JERRY: Prognosis negative!?

ELAINE: He's not doing well. The doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.

JERRY: Oh my God.

KRAMER: Oh my God.

ELAINE: Just my luck, you know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. You know Jerry you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.

GEORGE: It's that bleak?

ELAINE: Mmm.

GEORGE: You know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something.

JERRY: We gotta confess.

KRAMER: Really?

JERRY: Yes!

KRAMER: We could be tried for murder.

JERRY: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb!

KRAMER: You're not gonna say anything, you got that?

JERRY: I'm telling and you can't stop me!

KRAMER: You're not!



GEORGE: Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. Nineteen hundred dollars worth.






JERRY: Oh yeah, that's the spot.

DELORES: What're you so tense about?

JERRY: Oh, nothing really, just a homicide.



JERRY: Oh that's terrific... Mulva.

DELORES: What?

JERRY: Mulva?

DELORES: Mulva?

JERRY: Oh my uh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's, she's a masseuse.

DELORES: Huh.

JERRY: Yeah.

DELORES: Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

JERRY: Oh, good idea.



DELORES: What are you doing?

JERRY: Oh, I was just looking for uh, some... gum or... mint.

DELORES: Oh, I have Junior Mints.

JERRY: No!



JERRY: No, I mean, no thank you, nah.





KRAMER: Any news?

JERRY: No, no news. You better get out of here.

KRAMER: Oh.

JERRY: Oh no, wait a second, wait a second. I, I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.

KRAMER: Ten four.

JERRY: Okay.



DELORES: Oh, hello.

KRAMER: Hello, I'm Kramer.

DELORES: Nice to meet you.

KRAMER: See you later.



DELORES: Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play.



JERRY: Oh, okay.

DELORES: You know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.

JERRY: Oh hey, there's a name you don't forget.

DELORES: Mmm. Bye Jerry.

JERRY: Bye.



DELORES: Oh, hi.

GEORGE: Oh hi, I'm George.



DELORES: Oh, nice to meet you George.



GEORGE: Yeah, I gave it a shot.



GEORGE: So, any word on the "artiste"?



JERRY: No, I haven't heard anything.

GEORGE: He he. Well, I got my triangles.



JERRY: Really.

GEORGE: Yep, you know, they really spruce up the apartment.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure.

JERRY: Well, I, I gotta call the hospital. I gotta tell them what happened.

GEORGE: No, no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Uh, You could get in trouble.

JERRY: Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

GEORGE: Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?

JERRY: Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel. It's about Roy Kordic's condition.

GEORGE: What? What?

JERRY: Oh, that's fantastic!

GEORGE: He didn't get better did he?

JERRY: Thank you very much. Okay. Bye bye. He's gonna be okay!

GEORGE: Where's the luck? There's no luck. Nineteen hundred dollars down the drain.




ROY: You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what you did for me.

GEORGE: Oh, well that's great. It's really great.

KRAMER: You know, art's a great investment.

ELAINE: And they're gonna look great in your apartment George.

GEORGE: Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.

ROY: Hey, George.

GEORGE: Yeah.



KRAMER: Aw, alright

JERRY: That's nice.

GEORGE: Thanks Roy.



ROY: Hey there's the guy who saved my life.



DOCTOR: You know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.

JERRY: What do you mean?

DOCTOR: I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above.



KRAMER:  Mint?

DOCTOR: Those can be very refreshing.





ROY: So Elaine, where are we going for our big dinner on Friday?



ELAINE: Uh, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey?



JERRY: I don't think so.

ELAINE: We are... that means that we ah, we are...

JERRY: I believe we're not.

ELAINE: Huh, please can we go to the Poconos?

JERRY: Well, I'll think about it.




DELORES: Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.

JERRY: Really.

DELORES: Uh huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.

JERRY: Oh, wait a second, you got her autograph?

DELORES: Yeah.

JERRY: Do you have it with you?

DELORES: Yeah, it's in my purse.

JERRY: Ah, Let me see.



DELORES: You know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.



JERRY: Oh well, I really think I'm falling for you.


JERRY: Joseph Puglia.

DELORES: I had it autographed for my uncle.

JERRY: Yeah, I, I know.

DELORES: You don't know my name, do you?

JERRY: Yes I do.

DELORES: What is it?

JERRY: It, it rhymes with a female body part.

DELORES: What is it?

JERRY: Mulva.



JERRY: Ah, Gipple?



JERRY: Loleola?



JERRY: Oh! Oh! Delores!
 



JERRY: Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school, they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones "I love those", "I hate those", "I hate those", "I love those".  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M and M and a light brown M and M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M and M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor. It's an after dinner M and M, really".
