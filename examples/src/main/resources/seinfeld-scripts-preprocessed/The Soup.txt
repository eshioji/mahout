

JERRY: You have a close friend and they get involved with someone in a relationship. It affects your friendship doesn't it? Because it's like you were a comedy team, and now there's this third person, you know, it kind of throws off the timing. Who's on first, I don't know, uh dear, who, who do you think is on first? In fact, whenever a friend of mine ah, starts with a new girlfriend, he should just say: �I look like the person you use to know, but I've been modified to survive in this relationship. In other words, if were having an argument and she's there, I may say I totally disagree with you, but what that means is, I'd like to help you out, but I'd rather continue to see her naked.�




WAITRESSKELLY: Okay cowboys, what'll you have?

JERRY: I'll have the uh, turkey club without the bacon.

GEORGE: And uh, I'll have the bacon club without the turkey.



WAITRESSKELLY: George, don't make me get tough with you.

GEORGE: Why, you think you can beat me up?

WAITRESSKELLY: You wouldn't want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours.

GEORGE: Huh, stop.



WAITRESSKELLY: You don't want bacon, I'll surprise you.



GEORGE: Wow, is she not terrific?

JERRY: She does have a way.

GEORGE: You think she thinks I have a beautiful face or is she just saying that?

JERRY: Well they do work on tips.

GEORGE: �George, don't make me get tough with you.� Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?

JERRY: Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.

GEORGE: Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.

JERRY: The omelet. Damn.

GEORGE: Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: No?

JERRY: Not possible.

GEORGE: Not possible?



ELAINE: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey Elaine.

JERRY: Lainey, how was the trip?



GEORGE: What trip? You were gone?

ELAINE: I went to England... with Mr. Pitt for five days.

GEORGE: Huh, how was it?

ELAINE: Actually it was great. I met an Englishman and we really hit it off.

JERRY: Yeah, well that relationship's really got a lot of potential.



ELAINE: Yeah well Jerome, I happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.

GEORGE: Flying him in? How long is he staying for?

ELAINE: It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.

GEORGE: All this in five days. Hmm.

JERRY: Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.



GEORGE: Who's he?

JERRY: Oh, he's this awful comedian.



BANIA: Hey Jerry.

JERRY: Hey Kenny.

JERRY: Elaine, George.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi.

BANIA: Hi.

JERRY: How's it going?

BANIA: Great. I've been working out. Went from a size forty to a forty-two.

JERRY: No kidding.

BANIA: Yeah, I'm huge.



BANIA: Well, I'll leave you guys alone.



JERRY: Alright.

ELAINE: Okay, thanks.



BANIA: Oh Jerry, you know what just hit me? I was thinking, what size suit are you?

JERRY: Ah, I'm a forty. Why?

BANIA: I just got a brand new Armani suit, doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?

JERRY: Well I don't know if I...

BANIA: Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?

ELAINE: An Armani suit?

GEORGE: Take the suit.

JERRY: Well... okay. I guess.

BANIA: You gonna be home later?

JERRY: Yeah.

BANIA: I'll drop it off.



GEORGE: Heh heh heh hey, new suit.



JERRY: Yeah, yeah, lucky me.



WAITRESSKELLY: Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. It's not even on the menu.



GEORGE: Oh, this is fabulous.






GEORGE: Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.

JERRY: Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put them on the glass.

GEORGE: You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no man's land and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell you!



JERRY: Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!



JERRY: Get in there.








KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Listen, I need you to do me a favor.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: because I'm getting rid of it.



JERRY: Yeah?

BANIA: It's Kenny Bania, I have the suit.

JERRY: Alright, come on up.



KRAMER: So.

JERRY: Well well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator?



KRAMER: Well after that kidney stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. I'm not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.

JERRY: What for?

KRAMER: Well I could put a dresser in there. I could get dressed while I'm making breakfast.



BANIA: Hey.



BANIA: Here you go.



JERRY: Yeah.

BANIA: You didn't think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?

KRAMER: What, you're giving him this suit?

BANIA: That's right, and it's an Armani.

KRAMER: Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry.



JERRY: Yes yes, I heard.

KRAMER: Come on, try it on.



JERRY: No, it's okay.

KRAMER: Come on, I want to see how it fits.

JERRY: Alright, alright.



KRAMER: There you go.

JERRY: Okay, yeah all right.

KRAMER: Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.

BANIA: I don't even want anything for it.



KRAMER: He's very generous, isn't he?

JERRY: Yes, yes he is.

BANIA: I'll tell you what, you can take me out to dinner sometime.



JERRY: Dinner?

BANIA: Yeah. You buy me a meal, you can't get a better deal than that.



KRAMER: No, you'll never get a better deal than that.

BANIA: Alright, I'll leave you alone.



JERRY: Yeah, I'll see you.

KRAMER: Alright, oh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.



JERRY: Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. I'd rather make my own suit.



GEORGE: I did it! It's all done!

JERRY: Hey.



GEORGE: I did it. Huh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, I'm much better in the daytime then I am at night. It�s less pressure.

JERRY: I love the day date. No wine, No shower.

GEORGE: There you go.




ELAINE: So the trip was good?

SIMON: Yes. Apart from that dreadful airline food. It tends to wreak havoc with my stomach.

ELAINE: You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food.

SIMON: That's probably because of...

ELAINE: What?

SIMON: What?

ELAINE: Yeah, what?



ELAINE: What?

SIMON: Where I come from, we don't say �What?� It's proper to say �Pardon?�

ELAINE: Huh. This should be interesting.

SIMON: Pardon?

ELAINE: Nothing.




WAITRESSKELLY: So then about a year ago I started selling these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment.



WAITRESSKELLY: I'm just doing this waitress thing for a while because I wanted to go to Europe this summer.

GEORGE: Ah.

WAITRESSKELLY: And I could use a few extra, careful.



GEORGE: Oh. It's just horse manure.



GEORGE: Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word �manure.� You know, it's, it's �nure,� which is good. and a �ma� in front of it. Manure. I mean when you consider the other choices, �manure� is actually pretty refreshing.



WAITRESSKELLY: That's a nice watch George.

GEORGE: Yeah.

WAITRESSKELLY: You know my boyfriend has the same one.

GEORGE: Huh. Really?

WAITRESSKELLY: Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak.

GEORGE: Well, how about that?

WAITRESSKELLY: Oh, look out.



WAITRESSKELLY: You stepped right in it.

GEORGE: Yes, I sure did.




JERRY: So you just pretended it didn't bother you?

GEORGE: What is that, boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?

JERRY: Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. �Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak.� Well that's fabulous.



JERRY: Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?

GEORGE: I said, �Would you like to go for a walk or something.�

JERRY: Oh, a walk, well...

GEORGE: Or something. I said, �Or something!�

JERRY: Or something. Yeah, that's a date.

GEORGE: There you go.

JERRY: Course you know there is always the possibility that she called an audible.

GEORGE: What do you mean?

JERRY: Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn't like the looks of the defense and changed the play.

GEORGE: I think things were going okay. We were having a nice conversation.

JERRY: Uh huh.

GEORGE: I mentioned how I liked horse manure.

JERRY: You did?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Yeah? You said you liked horse manure?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Hmm.

GEORGE: You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a �nure� with a �ma� in front of it. Manure. It's not bad.

JERRY: And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?

GEORGE: Yeah. Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I was just saying how it takes a negative thing and puts it on a positive spin on it.

JERRY: I'm just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.

GEORGE: So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?

JERRY: My honest opinion, I think she made it up.

GEORGE: Well then she's just a liar, isn't she?



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Ah. Well, you want something to eat, don't you?

KRAMER: Ah, no no no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.

GEORGE: Well what do you eat?

KRAMER: It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it.



KRAMER: I eat it.

JERRY: Well I'm glad it's working out.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggie's.

JERRY: Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.

KRAMER: Yeah, well I'll tell you, she's a full figured gal.

JERRY: Is she?

KRAMER: Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.

GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah we could. You know ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.

KRAMER: Alright it's done.





JERRY: Hello?

BANIA: Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.

JERRY: Oh, Hi.

BANIA: You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?



JERRY: Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?

BANIA: How about Mendy's, oh, ever been there?

JERRY: No, I haven't.

BANIA: Ah you're gonna love it. I'll meet you there around seven.

JERRY: Alright.

BANIA: Ah.



JERRY: Yeah, I really needed that suit.




BANIA: I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep.



BANIA: I do ten reps, two sets.

JERRY: Mmm. That's fantastic.

BANIA: You work out with weights?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BANIA: You should.

JERRY: Why?



BANIA: You worn the suit yet?

JERRY: No, not yet.

MENDYSWAITER: have you decided?

BANIA: Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.

JERRY: I'll have the salmon.

MENDYSWAITER: And you?

BANIA: Ah, you know what I think? I'm just going to have soup. Yeah, I'll save the meal for another time.

JERRY: Another time? What other time?

BANIA: I had a hot dog earlier. I'm not that hungry.

JERRY: No no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.

BANIA: Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.

JERRY: I'm not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.

BANIA: But I don't want anything but soup.

JERRY: Then that's the meal.

BANIA: But I had the hot dog.

JERRY: I didn't tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?

BANIA: Hey, I give you a brand new Armani suit and you won't even buy me a meal?

JERRY: Alright, fine. Get the soup!




JERRY: So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.

ELAINE: What kind of soup did he get?

JERRY: I don't know? Consomme or something.

ELAINE: Consomme, hmm.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten,Chicken Gumbo or Matzoth Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hearty soups.

JERRY: Elaine you're missing the whole point.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, it's a meal.

ELAINE: Was it a cup or a bowl?

JERRY: You see ah, uh...

ELAINE: I'm just curious.

JERRY: A bowl, okay?

ELAINE: Did he crumble any crackers in it?



ELAINE: Did he crumble any crackers in it?

JERRY: As a mater of fact, he did.

ELAINE: Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That, that could be a meal.

JERRY: It's like I'm talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.



ELAINE: Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.

SIMON: Hello. Elaine, do you have any cash on you?

ELAINE: Um, yeah in my purse.

SIMON: No. There was only six dollars.

JERRY: Well, I have some money. What do you need?



SIMON: Well, twenty should cover me.



SIMON: Thanks mate.



ELAINE: Where you going?

SIMON: Just visiting.

ELAINE: Oh, okay, see you later.

SIMON: I won't be back for dinner.



ELAINE: Pardon?




JERRY: So is she working? Is she here?

GEORGE: Yeah yeah, she's here.

JERRY: Have you said anything to her?

GEORGE: No, but I'm very uncomfortable.

JERRY: Are you going to say anything?

GEORGE: There she is.



GEORGE: No no no no no no.

WAITRESSKELLY: Hello

GEORGE: Hello.

WAITRESSKELLY: Well, what's it going to be?

GEORGE: What's it gonna be?

WAITRESSKELLY: Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that vein.

GEORGE: I'll uh, I'll just have a bowl of chili.

JERRY: I'll have an egg white omelet.



GEORGE: What's it gonna be? You hear that?

JERRY: Yeah, that was bad.

GEORGE: Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter. There's no more banter.



JERRY: Oh no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down.



BANIA: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

BANIA: You worn the suit yet?

JERRY: Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.

BANIA: You did?

JERRY: Oh, I'm joking.

BANIA: Oh! Can I squeeze in?

GEORGE: Sure you can.



WAITRESSKELLY: Can I take your order?

BANIA: What kind of soup do you have?

JERRY: Why don't you get a sandwich?

BANIA: Okay, I'll have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.

JERRY: Okay. This is it, you know.



JERRY: This is the meal, so stock up buddy boy.

BANIA: What are you talking about? This isn't a meal.



JERRY: Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.

BANIA: You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendy's.

JERRY: I tried to do that.

BANIA: This is lunch in a coffee shop.

JERRY: Doesn't matter, this is it. This completes the transaction.

BANIA: Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture?

BANIA: I'm really not comfortable...



KRAMER: Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.

GEORGE: Yeah.

KRAMER: She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.






JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Where's Simon?

ELAINE: Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And I'm not expecting any change.

JERRY: When's he leaving?

ELAINE: About two days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money and no prospects.



SIMON: Hey mate. Fancy a beer?

JERRY: Ah, no thanks.





JERRY: Hello? No, I'm sorry Bania. I'm not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and two bowls of soup and that's it. Good bye.



JERRY: Hey, what size suit are you?

SIMON: Forty.

JERRY: Forty. Perfect. Brand new Armani suit, you want it?

SIMON: Absolutely.



JERRY: Great, it�s yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, here's the car keys.



ELAINE: Thanks.



JERRY: Yeah?

BANIA: Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.

JERRY: I don't have your suit. I gave it away.



BANIA: Well it's my suit.

JERRY: Well it's gone. I'm sorry. Good bye Bania.



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Um, yeah.



KRAMER: Oh, uh, well, how's everything?

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: Good, ah, what's going on?

JERRY: Nothing.

KRAMER: Really.

JERRY: You want food, don't you?

KRAMER: It's not for me. It's for Hilde, the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food... there's gonna be trouble.

JERRY: Alright, go ahead

KRAMER: Thanks buddy.





HILDY: Did you find anything!

KRAMER: Uh, yeah, ah...



KRAMER: There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah...

HILDY: Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind?

KRAMER: Uh, Swiss.

HILDY: Alright, it'll have to do. Come on.






JERRY: What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?

GEORGE: I can't go in there. I'm too uncomfortable.

JERRY: Oh, what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?

ELAINE: Hey, What are you doing out here?

JERRY: We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.

GEORGE: What's the difference? Let's go to Reggie's.

ELAINE: Reggie's? I can't eat anything there.

GEORGE: It's the same menu.

ELAINE: There's no �big salad.�

GEORGE: They'll make you a �big salad.� What do you think, they're the only one's that make a �big salad�?

ELAINE: Alright. Let's go to Reggie's.



JERRY: So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?

ELAINE: Ah, wait till you hear this.




ELAINE: So Simon picks this woman up right in front of me.

JERRY: Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, �No egg white omelets.� Look at that.

GEORGE: So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.



HILDY: Hello.

JERRY: Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?

HILDY: Did you read the menu?

JERRY: Alright, just give me a western.

ELAINE: How about a big salad?

HILDY: A big salad?

ELAINE: You see?

GEORGE: Just tell her what you want, they'll make it for you.

ELAINE: It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.

HILDY: I can bring you two small salads.

ELAINE: Could you put it in a big bowl?

HILDY: We don't have big bowls.

ELAINE: Alright. Just give me a cup of decaf.

HILDY: We have Sanka.






GEORGE: I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for seven years. She's been there three weeks.

JERRY: Not fair.

GEORGE: If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!

JERRY: She's on your turf.

GEORGE: If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.

JERRY: You're the best.

GEORGE: Well, but how do I get someone else fired?

JERRY: Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected outwardly.



KRAMER: Hey. She's hungry Jerry.

JERRY: Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.

KRAMER: No food? Well you gotta have something.



KRAMER: I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.

HILDY: Food!

KRAMER: There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.

JERRY: Why'd she get fired?

KRAMER: Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn't like it.






ELAINE: So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.

JERRY: Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?

ELAINE: Yes. He's one of those bounders.



WAITRESSKELLY: Egg white omelet and big salad.

ELAINE: Ah. Thank you.

WAITRESSKELLY: I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips. Thank God I don't have to do this any more.



ELAINE: Ah.



BANIA: Hey Jerry, where's my suit?

JERRY: I don't have it. You want half my omelet?





MONKSMANAGER: I told you, she's busy. She can't come to the phone now! 


MONKSMANAGER: You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here.

WAITRESSKELLY: Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble.



MONKSMANAGER: Hey! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend George that the next time I see him around here, I'm going to turn him into my own personal hand puppet.





SIMON: Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, I'm a man of my word. 


ELAINE: When are you leaving?

SIMON: Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due to this suit. How do I look? I'm a shoe in aren't I. Thanks again love.



ELAINE: Hey Kenny, you still want to get that suit back?

BANIA: Yeah!

ELAINE: There it goes.



BANIA: Hey! Hey!



BANIA: Come here you!



SIMON: What are you doing? Unhand me!

BANIA: Take it off!
