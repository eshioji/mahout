

JERRY: It seems pretty hard to justify, at this point in human history, the existence of men and their handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, yup, got everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just proud of anything that comes out of us? Well, actually have a monogram sewn on to it. What is the source of pride here? Well, uh, sticking out of the breast pocket of our jacket. "I have a snot rag."









MRLIPPMAN: To your promotion.

ELAINE: Oh, thank you!



ELAINE: Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr. Lippman. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.

MRLIPPMAN: Well, you're really on your way now.



ELAINE: You really ought to do something about that cold.




JERRY: You got a raise?

ELAINE: I don't fool around, baby!

JERRY: I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.

ELAINE: They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.

JERRY: Oh, when did that happen?

ELAINE: They're signing the papers next week.

JERRY: Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?

ELAINE: Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.

JERRY: Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmel.

ELAINE: Yeah, it's getting serious. We're talking about moving in together.

JERRY: Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.



JERRY: Speaking of having it all, where were you?

GEORGE: I went to the beach.



JERRY: Oh, the beach.



GEORGE: It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.



JERRY: What is it that isn't working?

GEORGE: Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking.



GEORGE: I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.

JERRY: Could I get napkin over there?

GEORGE: It became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision I've ever made in my entire life has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat. It's all been wrong. Everywhere.



WAITRESS: Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.

GEORGE: Yeah. No no no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of tuna on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, not toasted with a side of potato salad... and a cup of tea.



ELAINE: Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.

JERRY: You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, because salmon swim against the current.



JERRY: And the tuna swim with it.



GEORGE: Good for the tuna.



ELAINE: Ah, George, you know that woman just looked at you.

GEORGE: So what? What am I supposed to do?

ELAINE: Go talk to her.

GEORGE: Elaine, bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don't approach strange women.

JERRY: Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.

GEORGE: Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.

JERRY: If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.

GEORGE: Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day. So now I will do the opposite and I will do something!



GEORGE: Excuse me, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.

VICTORIA: Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.



GEORGE: My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.

VICTORIA: I'm Victoria. Hi.








JERRY: Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright, okay, bye. 




KRAMER: Hey buddy, it's all happening!

JERRY: What's happening?

KRAMER: The coffee table book. It's a go!

JERRY: Oh yeah, I heard all about it.

KRAMER: You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop, Regis and Kathy Lee.

JERRY: You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?

KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it!

JERRY: I'll loan you my puffy shirt.

KRAMER: No no no.

JERRY: What're you gonna talk about?

KRAMER: Well, coffee tables.



JERRY: Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Okay. Great. Bye.



JERRY: You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.

KRAMER: You know who you are? Even Steven






VICTORIA: Are you growing a beard?

GEORGE: Why shave every day? It just grows right back.

VICTORIA: I guess.

GEORGE: I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.



VICTORIA: Hey watch it, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!

GEORGE: Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.






ANNOYINGMANONE: Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?

ANNOYINGMANTWO: Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!



VICTORIA: What are we gonna do? Should we just move?

GEORGE: That won't be necessary.



GEORGE: Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut them for you, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me! Because I would love it!






VICTORIA: Are you sure you don't wanna come up? I mean, it's only nine thirty.

GEORGE: I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.

VICTORIA: Who are you, George Costanza?

GEORGE: I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.






MICHAELKASTEN: Excuse me, is your name Elaine?

ELAINE: Yes.

MICHAELKASTEN: Were you supposed to meet a Jake Jarmel here?

ELAINE: Yeah.

MICHAELKASTEN: Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.

ELAINE: An accident? What happened?

MICHAELKASTEN: Well, he got side swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St. Vincent Hospital, room nine O seven.

ELAINE: Oh. Okay. Thank you.



ELAINE: Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?



COUNTERPERSON: There you go.






JAKE: So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.



ELAINE: Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.



ELAINE: You want one?

JAKE: No thanks.

ELAINE: So when do you think you're gonna get out of here?

JAKE: Where did you get those?

ELAINE: At the movies.

JAKE: Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?

ELAINE: Yeah, he did.

JAKE: Then when did you get those?

ELAINE: Right after... that...

JAKE: So you heard that I was in a car accident and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?

ELAINE: Well... the counter... was right there and...

JAKE: I would think under the circumstances it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently it didn't have any effect on you.

ELAINE: No no, it does!

JAKE: If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!

ELAINE: But Jake...

JAKE: I would like to be alone now, please.

ELAINE: But, Jake I didn't...

JAKE: Goodnight!








POKERPLAYERONE: Ah, what do you say we call it a night?

POKERPLAYERTWO: Good idea, I'm kind of tired.

POKERPLAYERTHREE: How'd you do?

POKERPLAYERFOUR: Won fifty.

POKERPLAYERTWO: Lost seventy-two.

POKERPLAYERONE: Won thirty-seven.

POKERPLAYERTHREE: Lost fifteen.

JERRY: Broke even.




REGIS: Can I bring out our next guest now?

KATHIELEE: Please, please.

REGIS: Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part.

KATHIELEE: I love this.

REGIS: It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!



KATHIELEE: Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!

REGIS: I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?

KATHIELEE: I did.

REGIS: I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?

KATHIELEE: I love his hair.

REGIS: Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome Kramer!



REGIS: Hello, Kramer is here.



KATHIELEE: I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!

REGIS: Ah well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?

KRAMER: Yeah, well ah, I'll tell you uh, Regis, actually, this is a true story. I um, I was skiing at the time.

REGIS: You know, when I'm skiing Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!

KATHIELEE: Have you always had an interest in coffee tables? Because, really, I, I love coffee tables and I, I thought I was the only one.

KRAMER: You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.



KATHIELEE: Is that fabulous?

REGIS: Look at this!

KATHIELEE: Is that fabulous?

REGIS: Fabulous!

KATHIELEE: I want one of these.

REGIS: Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?

KATHIELEE: This coffee table book is full of pictures of celebrities� coffee tables.

KRAMER: That's true. That's right.

REGIS: Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?

KRAMER: Oh, it's on file, right here.



REGIS: I'm telling you, this guy's bonkos! He really is!

KATHIELEE: But he's adorable.

REGIS: Yeah he is, he's a nice looking guy.



KATHIELEE: It's all over my dress.

REGIS: We'll be right back in a moment.




JERRY: So it's all over?

ELAINE: Yeah, it got pretty nasty.

JERRY: And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?

ELAINE: It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.

JERRY: Why didn't you eat it in the cab?

ELAINE: Because I got popcorn too and I ate that first.



ELAINE: What's all this?

JERRY: Played cards last night.

ELAINE: Oh yeah? How'd you do?

JERRY: Broke even.

ELAINE: You always break even.

JERRY: Yeah, I know. Like yesterday I lost a job and then I got another one and then I missed a TV show, and later on they ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!

ELAINE: Do you have twenty bucks?

JERRY: What for?

ELAINE: Just give me twenty bucks.



JERRY: What the hell was that?

ELAINE: Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.

JERRY: You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.

ELAINE: You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together.

JERRY: Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.



GEORGE: Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was...

JERRY: Bad.

GEORGE: Day was...

ELAINE: Night.

GEORGE: Yes!

JERRY: So you just did the opposite of everything?

GEORGE: Yes. And listen to this, listen to this. Her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.

JERRY: So I guess your Messiah would be the anti Christ.

GEORGE: Yes funny.



GEORGE: Let's go.



JERRY: Elaine look! A twenty!

ELAINE: Oh my God.




KRAMER: Hey boss.

MRLIPPMAN: Kramer. Come in.

KRAMER: How're you doing there, big guy?



MRLIPPMAN: Uh yeah, have a seat.

KRAMER: Alrighty.



KRAMER: Have you got yourself a cold?



KRAMER: Whoa, that's quite a honk!

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah, thank you.

KRAMER: Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavonoid.

MRLIPPMAN: The reason I asked you in here is I, I caught your appearance on uh, "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and...

KRAMER: Yeah that was pretty good, huh?



MRLIPPMAN: Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you uh, didn't do any more of these shows.

KRAMER: Because of the coffee thing?

MRLIPPMAN: Kramer, I'm sorry.

KRAMER: What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not canceling "Sonia Live"?

MRLIPPMAN: It's out.

KRAMER: She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.

MRLIPPMAN: Kramer I...








MRCUSHMAN: Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience?

GEORGE: Alrighty. Ah, my last job was in publishing. I uh, got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.

MRCUSHMAN: Go on.

GEORGE: Ah, alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.

MRCUSHMAN: Do you talk to everybody like this?

GEORGE: Of course.

MRCUSHMAN: My niece told me you were different.

GEORGE: I am different, yeah.

MRCUSHMAN: I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.



MRCUSHMAN: Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet.



MRCUSHMAN: This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.

MRSTEINBRENNER: Nice to meet you.

GEORGE: Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of New York a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!

MRSTEINBRENNER: Hire this man!








PENDANTMAN: Who's that?

ELAINE: Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I, I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.

PENDANTMAN: Alright, see you.



PENDANTMAN: Hey.

TINA: Please.

ELAINE: Hi Tina.

TINA: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: So, I haven't seen you in a while.

TINA: Elaine, we have a problem.

ELAINE: Well, what is it?

TINA: You're getting kicked out.

ELAINE: Kicked out?! Why?!

TINA: Well, there's been a number of complaints.

ELAINE: Yeah? Like what?

TINA: Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.

ELAINE: Ah, I didn't know who he was!

TINA: That's why there's a buzzer.

ELAINE: What else?

TINA: Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehovah�s Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.

ELAINE: What else have you got?

TINA: Well, let's see.








JERRY: I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.

RACHEL: I suppose.

JERRY: Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.

RACHEL: Jerry.

JERRY: Yes?

RACHEL: I've been doing a lot of thinking.

JERRY: Uh huh?

RACHEL: Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.

JERRY: Oh, that's okay.

RACHEL: What?

JERRY: Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.

RACHEL: You will?

JERRY: Sure. See, things always even out for me.

RACHEL: Huh?

JERRY: It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh, good luck!

RACHEL: Yeah, you too.



JERRY: She'll be coming around the mountain...






JERRY: The New York Yankees?!

GEORGE: The New York Yankees!

JERRY: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle... Costanza?

GEORGE: I'm the assistant to the traveling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane. I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!

JERRY: I can't believe it.



GEORGE: Yeah!

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's me.

JERRY: Come on up.

GEORGE: And I'm moving out of my parents house, I'm taking that apartment on eighty-sixth street, remember the one we saw?

JERRY: That's a great place!

GEORGE: I'm back in business, baby!

JERRY: George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.



GEORGE: Hey!

JERRY: Hi Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: How're things going?

ELAINE: How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!

JERRY: Why? Why are they doing that?

ELAINE: I don't know! They have a list of grievances.

JERRY: The jewel thief?

ELAINE: Yeah, the jewel thief.

JERRY: What else?

ELAINE: I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.

GEORGE: Well, you could move in with my parents.



ELAINE: Was that the opposite of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct?



GEORGE: Instinct.

ELAINE: Stick with the opposite.



JERRY: Elaine, don't get too down. Everything will even out. See, I have two friends, you were up...



JERRY: ...he was down. Now he's up...



JERRY: ...you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?






MRLIPPMAN: Oh yeah, alright. Tell them I'll be right there.



MRLIPPMAN: Oh man, well, this is it Elaine. You know without this merger we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.



ELAINE: Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.



CHAIRMAN: Ah Lippman son.



CHAIRMAN: Lippman son.



INTERPRETER: Mr. Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.



MRLIPPMAN: I, I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.






JERRY: Is that the end of it?

GEORGE: Yeah, it's the last one.

JERRY: Alright.

ESTELLE: I can't believe you're moving out. Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's, it's like a dream.

KRAMER: Oh, it's true.

GEORGE: Alright, let's go.

FRANK: Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice.



GEORGE: I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.

ESTELLE: Jerry, did you hear this?

JERRY: He knows what he's doing.



GEORGE: I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.



JERRY: Opposite.






ELAINE: I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!

JERRY: Why'd you have to eat so many?

ELAINE: Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.

JERRY: Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.

KRAMER: Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? Yeah!

ELAINE: Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.

JERRY: Don't say that.

ELAINE: It's true. I'm George! I'm George!



GEORGE: Greetings people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two!



GEORGE: Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get darling. So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr. Don Mattingly. He's the first base man.

ELAINE: Uh huh.

GEORGE: We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said, "Donny, go with it till it stops working." Donny baseball. He's a hell of a guy.



KRAMER: Wait wait wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.

JERRY: Ah, let's call it even.




JERRY: Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories. Alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get is more alcohol and maybe a rag for your squeegee.
