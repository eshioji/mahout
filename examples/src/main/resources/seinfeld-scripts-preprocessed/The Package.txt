

NURSE: The doctor will be with you in a moment.





ELAINE: Difficult? 



DRBERG: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that.



DRBERG: So tell me about this uh, rash of yours. 

ELAINE: Well it's, it's... You know I noticed that someone wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of ninety-two and I have to tell you I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse had asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and actually I'd specifically worn a tank top so that I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. 

DRBERG: Well that was a long time ago.



DRBERG: How about if I just erase it.



DRBERG: Now about that rash.

ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase. 

DRBERG: Alright Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You should be fine.



ELAINE: What are you writing?



ELAINE: Doctor?






SHEILA: Here you go. 

GEORGE: Thanks. 

SHEILA: I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt. 

GEORGE: Oh.








KRAMER: What's the matter with your stero?

JERRY: I don't know, what's the matter with your stereo?

KRAMER: I traded it to Lomez for some steaks.



GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: See this is busted.

JERRY: No, it works.

KRAMER: It's busted.

JERRY: Watch out, let me show you.



JERRY: All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. 

GEORGE: Smile.



JERRY: What are you doing? 

GEORGE: Ah, I meet this uh, woman, Sheila. She works down at the uh, one hour photo place. She's got this incredible smile. It's like she's got too many teeth or something.

JERRY: Oh, extra teeth. I love that look. 

GEORGE: Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says, " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt." 

JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?  

GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it. 

JERRY: I see. She's looking. 

GEORGE: Yes. 

KRAMER: Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. 

JERRY: They've tried to fix it. It keeps coming back the same. 

KRAMER: Would you be interested in a refund? 

JERRY: Well I can't, the warranty expired two years ago. 

KRAMER: Would you be interested? 

JERRY: Well how are you... 

KRAMER: Nah, nah, would you? 

JERRY: I guess I would. 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. 



ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctor�s office today. 

JERRY: Not the gown again. 

ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said that I was difficult. Why would they write that? 

JERRY: They have gotten to know you. 



ELAINE: And then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. 

GEORGE: Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know you�re difficult? 

ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. 

JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. 

ELAINE: Listen to me you little...

GEORGE: Smile.






DRSTERN: Elaine, you really didn't have to put on the gown. 

ELAINE: Oh, it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. 



ELAINE: Hi.

DRSTERN: Alrighty.



DRSTERN: Let me just review your history before we begin. 

ELAINE: Oh, where did you get my chart? 

DRSTERN: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure. 

ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just... 



DRSTERN: Okay. Let's take a look.



DRSTERN:  Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.



ELAINE: Please, please. It's really, really itchy. 



ELAINE: Oh no.






POSTALWORKER: Seinfeld? 

JERRY: Yeah. 

POSTALWORKER: I got a package for you. Sign here. 

JERRY: Oh, who's it from? 

POSTALWORKER: No return address. 

JERRY: What if I don't want it? 

POSTALWORKER: Are you refusing delivery? 

JERRY: Maybe I am. 

POSTALWORKER: Why would you do that? 

JERRY: I've never done it before. 

POSTALWORKER: Why start now? 

JERRY: Why not? 



POSTALWORKER: Alright.





GEORGE: Why did you refuse that, everybody loves a package. 

JERRY: I don't know, it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. 

GEORGE: So what do you think it's a bomb? 

JERRY: It's not totally impossible. 

GEORGE: Oh, the ego on you. 

JERRY: Why can't I be bombable? 

GEORGE: Who's going to bomb you? An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes?

JERRY: Oh, I suppose you think you�re bombable. 

GEORGE: Hey, there�s a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. 

JERRY: There's more than a couple. 

GEORGE: Hey. Check these out.



GEORGE: I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these. 

JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes. 

GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. 

JERRY: The driver seems a little put out. 

GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out. 

JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds? 

GEORGE: Wax Museum. 

JERRY: Oh. 

GEORGE: Oh. What is this?



JERRY: That's a lot of skin. 

GEORGE: This must be Sheila from the photo place. 

JERRY: You can barely see her face. 

GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here. 



KRAMER: Ay yi yi.

GEORGE: Photo store Sheila. 

KRAMER: Well hello photo store Sheila. 

GEORGE: Alright, I will see you boys later. 

JERRY: Where are you going? 

GEORGE: To ask her out. 

KRAMER: No no, you�re not playing the game. 

GEORGE: What game? 

KRAMER: She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is, "Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please?" 

GEORGE: No good? 

KRAMER: George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. 

GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. 

KRAMER: Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. 

JERRY: Oh yeah, I like this idea. 




UNCLELEO: Hey Danny! Hello! How are you? 

POSTALWORKER: Hey Leo. Hey what's up with your nephew? He wouldn't accept a package. 

UNCLELEO: Oh, he wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it.






ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart. 

GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like. 

ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart. 

GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time. 

ELAINE: You are?

GEORGE: Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone? 

ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card?

GEORGE: Oh right, the nipple.



GEORGE: But uh, aside from that. How did you feel about Kramer's work? 

ELAINE: Oh, actually I thought he was very professional. 

GEORGE: So it was a good experience?

ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and I'm using as my health club ID. 

GEORGE: Nice. 

ELAINE: Yeah, it is nice actually. 




ELAINE: Please, I got to see Dr. Berg right away. This rash is spreading. 

DRBERGSSECRETARY: He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy. 

ELAINE: Oh come on, have some compassion.





ELAINE: Okay, well I hope it's contagious.



ELAINE: Come on. Move.



ELAINE: Oh, hi Dr. Berg. I didn't know if...

DRRESNICK: The chart Miss Benes.



ELAINE: Oh.



ELAINE: Oh please, no more. 






GEORGE: Hey, where's Kramer? 

JERRY: He went to get some steak sauce. Why? 

GEORGE: Personal matter. 





JERRY: Hello?

UNCLELEO: Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello! 

JERRY: Hello Leo. You don't have to yell. 

UNCLELEO: I got your package. 

JERRY: How did you get my package? 

GEORGE: Leo's got your package?

UNCLELEO: What should I do with it? 

JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it. 

GEORGE: Tell him to open it. 

JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. 

UNCLELEO: Jerry, your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Department production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me. 

JERRY: Open the package Leo. 

UNCLELEO: Okay. Opening.

JERRY: Opening. 








ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb. 

JERRY: No, no bomb. 

ELAINE: Well then what? 

JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. 

ELAINE: But he's okay? 

JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache, everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. 



ELAINE: Yeah, I am still holding. 



JERRY: Is this my stereo? 



KRAMER: Hey, you got it. 

JERRY: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. 

KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for four hundred dollars. 

JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund. 

KRAMER: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. 

JERRY: So were going to make the post office pay for my new stereo now? 

KRAMER: It's a write off for them. 

JERRY: How is it a write off? 

KRAMER: They just write it off. 

JERRY: Write it off what? 

KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything 

JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. 

KRAMER: Do you? 

JERRY: No. I don't. 

KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off. 

JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. 



ELAINE: What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello? 

JERRY: Still no luck 



ELAINE: Jerry, I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet. 

JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph?

ELAINE: There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am.

JERRY: Hey what about Dr. Resnick? My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow.

ELAINE: Dr. Resnick? He's not listed. 

JERRY: He's not that good. 




GEORGE: Elaine said you�re pretty good at this stuff. 

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her. 

GEORGE: You don't have your own camera?

KRAMER: Uh no. Look at this. Okay, yeah this looks good and I like what you�re wearing. 

GEORGE: I feel fat. 

KRAMER: No no, you're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because you�re a fun guy. Alright let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that t-shirt. 

GEORGE: Well do you want me to take it off? 

KRAMER: I don't know it's up to you. 

GEORGE: Do you think it would be better if I did? 

KRAMER: It might be. I mean whatever you want. 

GEORGE: Alright! 



KRAMER: That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on, work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man. 



KRAMER: You are a lover boy!! 

JERRY: Oh yeah. This can't miss. 






ELAINE: Hello. 



ELAINE: Yes. Who it this? 



ELAINE: Yeah. What is this all about?



ELAINE: Hello, hello?



ELAINE: Oh, uh uh... 






UNCLELEO: Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here? 

ELAINE: Leo. Has the doctor been in yet? 

UNCLELEO: No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows. 

ELAINE: Okay, listen Leo, your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay?



DRRESNICK: Leo. I heard you had a little mishap. 

UNCLELEO: It was a fireball. 

ELAINE: I should have never left him alone. 

DRRESNICK: And who are you? 

ELAINE: I am his nurse... Poloma. 

UNCLELEO: You're not my nurse. 

ELAINE: He has good days and bad. 

DRRESNICK: What seems to be the problem? 

UNCLELEO: Are my eyebrows going to grow back? 

ELAINE: And he's has a bit of a rash. 

DRRESNICK: Really?

ELAINE: Yeah. 

DRRESNICK: Well there's been a bit of that going around lately. Will you excuse me Poloma? I just need to get some ointment. 

ELAINE: I don't like this, it is too easy. 

UNCLELEO: Elaine.

ELAINE: Shut up! I think he's on to us. 

UNCLELEO: Elaine what about my eyebrows? 

ELAINE: Shh. Here. 






JERRY: I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer? 

POSTALOFFICIAL: I am sorry. It looks like the claim has been red flagged. You�re under investigation. 

JERRY: Investigation? 

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. 

JERRY: Hello Newman. 

NEWMAN: Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud. 

KRAMER: Mail fraud. You�re in a lot of trouble buddy. 




DRRESNICK: I got your ointment. Where's your nurse? 

UNCLELEO: She left. 



DRRESNICK: No need to get angry. Calm down. 

UNCLELEO: I am calm. 

DRRESNICK: Leo, I don't care for your demeanor. 

UNCLELEO: Demeanor? 

DRRESNICK: Now you�re just being difficult. 

UNCLELEO: What are you writing? 




GEORGE: So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday. 

SHEILA: I am glad George. 

GEORGE: And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy. 

SHEILA: Great. 

GEORGE: Shall we say an hour?



SHEILA: Hey Ron, I got to go to lunch. Can you do a roll? 

PHOTOSTORERON: No problem. 

SHEILA: By the way. You know that model that is always in here. She's missing one of her lingerie shots. Have you seen it? 

PHOTOSTORERON: No. 





NEWMAN: Alright. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo? Huh? I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping. 

JERRY: Define rarely. 

NEWMAN: Frequently. 

JERRY: Are we about through here Newman?



NEWMAN: It's pretty hot under these lights, huh Seinfeld? Pretty... hot.

JERRY: Actually I am quite comfortable.



NEWMAN: Can I have a sip? 

JERRY: No. 

NEWMAN: Not going to play ball, huh? Alright, admit it that stereo was already busted. 

JERRY: You can't prove anything. 



NEWMAN: Is this or is this not your signature? 

JERRY: No, as a matter of fact it isn't. 



NEWMAN: Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry. 




ELAINE: Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it. 

KRAMER: Yeah, let me borrow your scarf. 

ELAINE: This?

KRAMER: Yeah. Alright, one chart coming up. 

ELAINE: Okay. 

KRAMER: Bennette right? 

ELAINE: Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah. 




NEWMAN: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.



NEWMAN: Jerry?




KRAMER: I like what you've done with that. 

DRRESNICKSSECRETARY: May I help you? 

KRAMER: Yes, yes. I am Dr. Van Nostrand from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh, very bad very messy. 

DRRESNICKSSECRETARY: I see, and what clinic is that again? 

KRAMER: That's correct. 

DRRESNICKSSECRETARY: Excuse me?

KRAMER: From the Hoffer Mandalay Clinic in Belgium. 

DRRESNICKSSECRETARY: Really? 

KRAMER: The Netherlands? 




ELAINE: Where's my chart? Did you get it? 

KRAMER: No. 

ELAINE: What? What happened? 

KRAMER: I don't know. But now they got a chart on me. 




SHEILA: I don't know where they could be. 

GEORGE: Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues. 

SHEILA: Well, if I find them I'll call you. 

GEORGE: And maybe we could go out and do something. 

SHEILA: Sure.



PHOTOSTORERON: Hello.



GEORGE: Hi. 



SHEILA: So the little guy finally asked me out. 

PHOTOSTORERON: Really? 

SHEILA: Hey, I can't find his photo's anywhere. 

PHOTOSTORERON: Oh, you know what happened? Some guy from the post office confiscated them. He left his card. 



SHEILA: Newman? 




GEORGE: I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for. 



NEWMAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out. 

JERRY: I'm clean and you know it. 

NEWMAN: Clean? Hardly.



NEWMAN: This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance. 

JERRY: Where did you get that? 

GEORGE: I think that's one of mine. 

NEWMAN: It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clam. 

JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation. 

NEWMAN: Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oh how I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to haul you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are! A monster so vile...

MAILGUY: Newman!! 

NEWMAN: There will be a small fine. 

JERRY: Okay. 

GEORGE: Can we go now? 

NEWMAN: Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.



JERRY: Oh my God!! 

NEWMAN: This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring. As does this one found in the same disturbing packet. 



GEORGE: Oh my God!! 

NEWMAN: We have a few questions we'd like you to answer. 

JERRY: I have a few questions of my own. 



SHEILA: Hi. One of your mailmen...



SHEILA: Oh my God, George?



GEORGE: Listen Sheila, it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful. 



JERRY: The timeless art of seduction. 

GEORGE: Sheila!!!






KRAMER: Oh geez. This was such a long drive.

UNCLELEO: That dirt road really hurt my back.

ELAINE: Okay, everybody just stop complaining. Smile. We're good patients.



COUNTRYDOCTOR: Okay, Miss Benes? You want to come on back?

ELAINE: Oh, I'd love to.



COUNTRYDOCTOR: Just a second.



COUNTRYDOCTOR: Hello? Yes? Well as a matter of fact they're here right now... I understand.
