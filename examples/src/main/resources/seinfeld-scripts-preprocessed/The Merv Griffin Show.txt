

JERRY: I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.

KRAMER: Well, what�s the difference? Come on we're like Cain and Able.

JERRY: Yeah, you know Cain slew Able.



KRAMER: No he didn�t. They were in business together, it was drywall or something.

JERRY: Oh no.

KRAMER: Alright then, what was it?

JERRY: Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came Able had all the nuts. Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.

KRAMER: The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.

JERRY: You broke my blender, didn�t you?

KRAMER: Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just, just didn�t work out.

JERRY: I knew it.




JERRY: Why were you making gravel?

KRAMER: Well, I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.



KRAMER: Ah, this looks familiar.

JERRY: Of course. It's garbage.

KRAMER: No no no no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show!



KRAMER: They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!

JERRY: Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.

KRAMER: Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing you're yesterday's trash.

JERRY: Come on Kramer, get out of there.

KRAMER: No no no, you go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look.



KRAMER: Merv Griffin's cigar.

JERRY: Oh.






GEORGE: You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hmm, can't smell anything can you?

MIRANDA: Banana?

GEORGE: Right.

MIRANDA: George watch out for those pigeons.

GEORGE: Oh, they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?



MIRANDA: Oh my God.



GEORGE: So uh, where we eating?






JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.

CELIA: You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.

JERRY: Wow!



CELIA: Oh yeah, the toys.

JERRY: Where did you get all these?

CELIA: My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with...

JERRY: Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe.



JERRY: With the full frogman suit.

CELIA: Jerry, what are you doing?

JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.

CELIA: Oh Jerry.



CELIA: They're priceless. They've never been played with.

JERRY: I just want a touch them a little.

CELIA: I said no. Now come here.








LOU: Hi.



LOU: I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.



ELAINE: Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?

WALTER: Uh, he's Lou Filerman. He's new here.



WALTER: Hey, your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.

ELAINE: You've been an enormous help.




JERRY: You ran over some pigeons? How many?

GEORGE: What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but I, I, it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?

JERRY: Of course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.

GEORGE: Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!

JERRY: So Miranda's cooled on you?

GEORGE: I'm getting nothing.

JERRY: Yeah, me neither.

GEORGE: Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?

JERRY: Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!



GEORGE: I don't understand women.

JERRY: Here comes one.

ELAINE: Hey. What's going on?

GEORGE: Hey.



GEORGE: Art Garfunkel?

ELAINE: No, Castro.

GEORGE: Right.

ELAINE: All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just, he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!

JERRY: So he just sidles up?

ELAINE: That's right! He's a real sidler.

JERRY: Maybe you just didn't see him.

ELAINE: You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup A Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".

JERRY: Hakuna Matata?

ELAINE: I thought I was alone.

JERRY: That doesn't make it right.




JERRY: See to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup.

ELAINE: Would you just let it go?



KRAMER: Hey Jerry! Come here a sec!



KRAMER: Hey!

JERRY: Oh my God!

KRAMER: It's the Merv Griffin set.

JERRY: How did you get this in here?

KRAMER: Oh, you just bring it in sideways and...



KRAMER: ...hook it.

JERRY: So where you gonna sleep?

KRAMER: Yeah, backstage.

ELAINE: Ew! This chair smells like garbage.

KRAMER: Oh, well a lot of the stars from the seventies, they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.



JERRY: I'm gonna get that.



KRAMER: Alright. Well Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime.





KRAMER: Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you!



KRAMER: Boy, is it possible that you�re even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?








GEORGE: Ah, we had a deal!






ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.

PETERMAN: One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. And done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly.



PETERMAN: It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.

ELAINE: What?






JERRY: So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.

KRAMER: Hmm, that's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.

JERRY: Yeah, that was me.

KRAMER: Oh, that's right, right right. And uh, you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an...

JERRY: An Army Pete.

KRAMER: Right.

JERRY: He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.

KRAMER: And we all know how painful that can be.





ELAINE: Jerry. Oh there...

KRAMER: Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come...



KRAMER: Come on sit down. Yes.

ELAINE: Well, I'll tell you, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.

KRAMER: Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.

ELAINE: Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.

KRAMER: Ah, now for those of us who don't know uh, sidling is what?

ELAINE: Kramer, what is wrong with you?

KRAMER: What do you mean?

ELAINE: Well, for starters you're looking at note cards



ELAINE: I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine so I am going to sidle the sidler.

JERRY: You sidle? You, you stomp around like a Clydesdale!

ELAINE: Not with these honeys.



ELAINE: Wrestling shoes!



KRAMER: Only in New York.

GEORGE: Jerry?



KRAMER: Oh!



KRAMER: Hey! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!







KRAMER: Yeah, sit sit sit. Well!



GEORGE: Well, it happened again.

JERRY: What happened?

KRAMER: I'll ask the questions. What happened?

GEORGE: Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They, they didn't move.

KRAMER: Alright, let's uh, change the subject ah.



KRAMER: Now uh, you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah, what was that like?



KRAMER: That was the wrong card.

GEORGE: I, I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It, it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!

JERRY: So they're like everyone else.

KRAMER: Alright, let's take a short break.



KRAMER: Okay ah...



KRAMER: We're back!




GEORGE: Boy that, that bank clock is, is eight minutes off.

MIRANDA: Then why don't you just run it over too?

GEORGE: Zing.



MIRANDA: George, what are you doing?

GEORGE: Did you see that? That, that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!

MIRANDA: What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel.



GEORGE: Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with them!








CELIA: Jerry!



CELIA: Those hands! They never stop!

JERRY: I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!

CELIA: No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?

JERRY: Alright.



JERRY: Oh, will not cause drowsiness.



JERRY: May cause drowsiness.






LOU: Here's the new copy you wanted.

PETERMAN: Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed... with both of you.



ELAINE: Thank you.



PETERMAN: Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.

ELAINE: Well, I guess we'll just have...



ELAINE: Oh, just give me that.








JERRY: Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe.






MIRANDA: Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?

VET: There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.

GEORGE: Well uh, are there any other options?

VET: We could put him to sleep.

GEORGE: What might that cost?

VET: Well it's by the pound. So... about eighty cents.

GEORGE: Well? I was just, I'm curious, that's all. We uh. we'd like you to do everything possible.

VET: He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?

GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah I, I know.




GEORGE: So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.

KRAMER: El Paso? I spent a month there one night.

NEWMAN: El Paso!





JERRY: What's he here for?

KRAMER: Ah, to take some of the pressure off of me. So Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. Mmm?

JERRY: Well actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.

KRAMER: Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear wedding bells?

NEWMAN: Are you married right now?

KRAMER: Newman.



JERRY: Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I guess she passed out!

KRAMER: What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?

JERRY: She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!

GEORGE: Oh come on! You gotta get me over there!

KRAMER: Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment.



KRAMER: Jerry, now what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set you clean it up, mister!

NEWMAN: I told you he was a risk.

JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!

NEWMAN: Yeah? Well you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!

KRAMER: Smile everyone! We're back!




LOU: You wanted to see me, Elaine?

ELAINE: Yes Lou. You've got a lot going for you. You're um... you're spontaneous. You're symmetrical. You're uh...



ELAINE: You're very quick, aren't you?. Um, It's just that your...

LOU: My dead tooth?

ELAINE: No. Your...



LOU: Not my breath?

ELAINE: Uh.

LOU: What can I do?

ELAINE: Well, you should never ever go anywhere...



ELAINE: ...without these.

LOU: Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady!








GEORGE: More wine and turkey?



CELIA: Hmm.



JERRY: So when I saw George on the street with an eighteen pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought What a coincidence, we're just about to eat.

CELIA: What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?

JERRY: Tryptophan

GEORGE: Tryptophan.

CELIA: Ah.

JERRY: I think. Have some more wine.



CELIA: What video did you get?

GEORGE: Oh.

JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.

GEORGE: Four hours.

JERRY: More heavy gravy?






GEORGE: Ah, Yes! Touchdown! Your turn, Jerry.






NEWMAN: Lately though, I've been uh, I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label, I can hardly tell the difference.

KRAMER: We've officially bottomed out, hmm. Who's our next guest?

NEWMAN: We got no one!

KRAMER: We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.



NEWMAN: What about a guest host?

KRAMER: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.




MIRANDA: Doctor, how's the squirrel?

GEORGE: Is he dead?

VET: No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?

MIRANDA: Yes he would.



VET: You uh, You have thirty minutes.



GEORGE: So uh, squirrel.



VET: One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.

GEORGE: What's that?

VET: Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.

GEORGE: He has no home. He's a squirrel.

VET: Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated.






JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.

GEORGE: It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!



KRAMER: Jerry, what are you doing tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.

JERRY: What about my "questionable material"?

KRAMER: Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus we got Jim Fowler!

JERRY: Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?

KRAMER: Well, I practically raised his kids.

GEORGE: That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. Can I bring the squirrel by?

KRAMER: What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur hour? Look George, I'm sorry, maybe another time alright?



GEORGE: I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!



ELAINE: Hey!



ELAINE: Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which, I think I�ve got that problem solved.

JERRY: Tic Tacs work?

ELAINE: He's a human maraca.

GEORGE: Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.

ELAINE: You took him over to Celia's?

JERRY: What? It's a victimless crime.

ELAINE: What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?

JERRY: Okay, one victim.

ELAINE: I think it's unconscionable.

GEORGE: Hey, last night I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.

ELAINE: EZ Bake oven?






ELAINE: Who wants cupcake?

GEORGE: Oh, me me me me me!

JERRY: You know, that batter is like, thirty years old.

FRANK: You step on it and it flushes.

ELAINE: Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?

ESTELLE: Stop squirming.

GEORGE: Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me.

JERRY: You're like eight years old.

ESTELLE: Georgie.

GEORGE: I was seven and a half.






PETERMAN: That noise. That's the noise!

ELAINE: What?

PETERMAN: That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!

ELAINE: No no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!

PETERMAN: That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?

ELAINE: No, Mister Peterman.

PETERMAN: Because if I hear one more rattle, just one, your out on your can. And if you are undead I'll find out about that too.








ELAINE: Lou! In here!



ELAINE: We have to talk.

LOU: Oh, right.



ELAINE: Oh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.

LOU: Why?

ELAINE: Because they're turning your teeth green?

LOU: I only buy the white ones.

ELAINE: Okay. Well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just, just mouth wash.

LOU: I can't. It burns my cankers.

ELAINE: Binaca?

LOU: Again.

ELAINE: Right right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!

LOU: I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that twenty years ago.

ELAINE: Well stinky, this is your lucky day.




KRAMER: Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.

FOWLER: Where are the cameras?



KRAMER: But first, we're talking with Jerry.



KRAMER: Okay Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy collection. How do you feel about that?

JERRY: It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.

KRAMER: And she doesn't know anything about this?

JERRY: No, not a thing.



KRAMER: Well Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!



CELIA: What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?

NEWMAN: Woah.

KRAMER: Woah.

JERRY: What, What is this? What is she doing here?

KRAMER: It's the new format. Scandals and Animals.

CELIA: If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!

NEWMAN: Go girl!

JERRY: Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?

NEWMAN: Oh!

KRAMER: Oh!



GEORGE: Mister Fowler, I, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science!

KRAMER: George I told you we're booked!

FOWLER: Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.



KRAMER: Oh, another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.

GEORGE: Uh.

FOWLER: No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!



GEORGE: Ah!

KRAMER: Are we getting this?






JERRY: So the whole set was destroyed?

KRAMER: Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.

GEORGE: Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work. Sorry about the set.

KRAMER: I�ll tell you it was a grind having to fill ten hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.

MIRANDA: I got the nut bread, George. Let's go.



JERRY: So the squirrel's gonna make it?

GEORGE: Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.

JERRY: On the couch? So you're...

GEORGE: Still getting nothing!



GEORGE: So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard we have no deal!!




CELIA: I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.

ELAINE: Oh well hey, I dated Jerry too. I, I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?

CELIA: Who's he?

ELAINE: Oh, he's nobody. Hey listen, let me top that off for you.
