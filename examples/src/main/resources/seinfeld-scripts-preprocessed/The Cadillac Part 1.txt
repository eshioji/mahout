



KRAMER: Hey! You're back!

JERRY: Oh, I'm back, baby.

KRAMER: Yeah, how was it?

JERRY: Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.

KRAMER: Good for you.

JERRY: I killed.

KRAMER: You killed.

JERRY: Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with them and not only that, the money was unbelievable.

KRAMER: Unbelievable.

JERRY: Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.

KRAMER: How much?

JERRY: Nah, nah. I'd rather...

KRAMER: Aw, come on.

JERRY: Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.

KRAMER: I tell you how much I make.

JERRY: And I'm always impressed.

KRAMER: Just show me the check, come on.

JERRY: Alright, fine. You wanna see it?

KRAMER: I wanna see it.

JERRY: Okay.



JERRY: Here, check that out.



KRAMER: Whoa! This is unbelievable.

JERRY: I told you.



KRAMER: My God, you're rich.

JERRY: Oh yeah.

KRAMER: I didn't know you made that kind of money. Jeez.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.

JERRY: I never should of told you.

KRAMER: You know Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?

JERRY: No, I can't feel anything.

KRAMER: Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?

JERRY: Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.

KRAMER: Really?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Well, you should Jerry.

JERRY: No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.

KRAMER: Now you see, that's nice.

JERRY: Maybe a Cadillac.

KRAMER: Cadillac. Oh la la.

JERRY: Yeah. That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. I'm gonna do it.

KRAMER: You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.

JERRY: Oh, isn't that what it's all about?








ELAINE: Who was Pippi Longstocking?

KATY: Pippi Longstocking? Hmm, I don't know.

ELAINE: Did she have anything to do with Hitler?

KATY: Hitler? Maybe.



GEORGE: Hey.

ELAINE: Hey George.

GEORGE: Have you seen Jerry? I told him two o'clock.



ELAINE: You remember Katy?

GEORGE: Mmm? Oh hi. Oh yeah yeah yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.

KATY: Also ear, nose and throat.

GEORGE: Nose. What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed?

KATY: He's funny.

ELAINE: Ah, you don't have to tell me.

GEORGE: Ah ladies, please please.

ELAINE: Oh, you know what? He got engaged.

KATY: Oh, you did? Oh.

GEORGE: What? Is that bad?

KATY: I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.

GEORGE: Oh ho, yeah?

KATY: You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.

GEORGE: Bald, huh?

KATY: Loves bald.

GEORGE: Loves bald? Wow. Who uh, who is she?

KATY: Marisa Tomei.

GEORGE: The actress?

KATY: Yeah.

GEORGE: You're friends with Marisa Tomei?

KATY: That's right.

GEORGE: That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!

KATY: Yeah, I know.

GEORGE: You were gonna fix me up with her?

KATY: Yeah, she's just been sitting home.

GEORGE: Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!

ELAINE: Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.






JERRY: I want this baby fully loaded. Well, how soon can you get it there? Oh, that's terrific. Okay, thanks, bye.



JERRY: Hey, guess what? I just bought my father a Cadillac

GEORGE: Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.

JERRY: Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.



GEORGE: You gonna sleep on the fold out?

JERRY: Yeah, yes.



GEORGE: Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?

JERRY: The actress?

GEORGE: Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?

JERRY: Oh yeah.

GEORGE: Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: She happens to be very good friends with her.

JERRY: Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE: Uh hmm.

JERRY: How does she know Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE: I don't know, I didn't ask.

JERRY: You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE: Not the point!

JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: Can I finish?

JERRY: Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.



GEORGE: Alright! So, she said that she could've fixed me up with her.

JERRY: What do you mean, could've?

GEORGE: Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.

JERRY: Oh!

GEORGE: Could of fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!

JERRY: Really?



GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.

JERRY: You know, she won an academy award?

GEORGE: Huh huh, like I don't know that? My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!

JERRY: Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.

GEORGE: I mean, you've seen her, right?

JERRY: Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.

GEORGE: Marisa Tomei!

JERRY: Yeah yeah yeah.

GEORGE: I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.



JERRY: You like full lips.

GEORGE: Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.



JERRY: Mmm hmm. Too bad you're engaged.

GEORGE: Yeah, too bad. Too bad.



JERRY: This is no good.



JERRY: Hi.

NICK: Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I, I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, huh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?

JERRY: No.

NICK: If you see him, could you just tell him the cable company was here?

JERRY: Sure.

NICK: Thanks.



JERRY: Nice people.



GEORGE: Listen, let me ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?

JERRY: Well, what about Susan?

GEORGE: I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!

JERRY: Would you tell Susan about it?

GEORGE: Not necessarily.

JERRY: Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.

GEORGE: Of course there's something wrong! We had a pact!



JERRY: Hey, cable guy's looking for you.

KRAMER: Oh yeah?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Oh. Yeah, I've been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.

JERRY: Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.

KRAMER: Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.

JERRY: You don't seem too bothered by it.

KRAMER: You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one" or "We'll be there between two and six!" And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?

JERRY: Boy, I've never seen you like this.

KRAMER: Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.






MARISATOMEI: ...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark.



SUSAN: Hey. Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?

GEORGE: Yeah.



SUSAN: I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?

GEORGE: I I I don't know.

SUSAN: Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.



SUSAN: Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.










ELAINE: Hello.

GEORGE: Elaine, it's me, George.



ELAINE: George. How come you're whispering?

GEORGE: Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favor. Um, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?

ELAINE: No.

GEORGE: Think a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and you know...

ELAINE: Uh George, I have no idea what you're talking about.

GEORGE: The actress.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Marisa Tomei!



SUSAN: What?

GEORGE: Uh, ah, nothing nothing.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, yeah, what about her?

GEORGE: Well um, I think I'd like to do it.

ELAINE: What? What?! George, no way. You're engaged!

GEORGE: A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.

ELAINE: Uh, no George!

GEORGE: Elaine.

ELAINE: Forget it!



GEORGE: Elaine! Elaine!!



GEORGE: Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!








ELAINE: I can't believe you're buying your father a car.

JERRY: And best of all, it's a Cadillac.

ELAINE: Oh. A Cadillac! Wow.



ELAINE: I had no idea you had this kind of money.

JERRY: Ah, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.

ELAINE: Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.

JERRY: Ah, it's just money.

ELAINE: So, when're you getting back from Florida?

JERRY: Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?

ELAINE: I don't know. Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.

JERRY: Are you okay?

ELAINE: Sure, sure.

JERRY: What was that?



KRAMER: Quiet, quiet.






NICK: Hey uh, you know the guy who lives here?

GEORGE: Yeah.



NICK: All morning I been waiting here. All morning.



NICK: The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.



KRAMER: I'm loving this.



GEORGE: Kramer, there's a guy out here that...

KRAMER: Yeah yeah, I know I know.



GEORGE: Oh, thanks very much for yesterday by the way.

ELAINE: Jerry, he wants me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!

GEORGE: Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!

ELAINE: You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?

GEORGE: So what? So what if I do?

ELAINE: You're engaged!

GEORGE: I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life knowing I could of been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!

JERRY: I notice you threw "stocky" in there.

GEORGE: Yeah, what the hell?!

ELAINE: George! It's cheating.

GEORGE: It's not cheating if there's no sex!

ELAINE: Yes it is!

GEORGE: Ah!

ELAINE: Jerry!



JERRY: Um, hold, hold on a second. I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.



GEORGE: Elaine, come on. Would you just make the call? Please make the call.

ELAINE: Yeah yeah, fine, I'll make...



GEORGE: Alright.



ELAINE: Eight-fifty.

JERRY: Oh, right.



ELAINE: So uh, how are you getting to the airport? Do you need a ride, or...

JERRY: No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.



ELAINE: You sure? You sure? Because, you know...

JERRY: Maybe I'll let you pick me up.

ELAINE: Okay.



ELAINE: Oh, hi. Um, is Katy there? What? Um, what? Oh, really?



ELAINE: Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.



ELAINE: Huh, she's in the hospital. She has an arrhythmia.

GEORGE: What about Marisa Tomei?!






HELEN: Morty, what do you have to open this box for? There's already a box of cookies open.

MORTY: I wanted a Chip Ahoy.

HELEN: I don't like all these open boxes.



MORTY: Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.



JERRY: Surprise!

MORTY: Jerry!

HELEN: Oh my god!

MORTY: What the hell are you doing here?

JERRY: I'm a good son.

HELEN: Just like that? No calls?

JERRY: Just like that.

MORTY: Boy, you are really something.

HELEN: To what do we owe this great honor?

JERRY: You wanna know? Come on outside.

MORTY: Outside? What's going on?

HELEN: Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.





JERRY: Come on, come on.








JERRY: Well, what do you think?

MORTY: Look at this! Look at this! You bought a Cadillac?!

JERRY: I bought it for you. It's yours.



MORTY: You what? You bought me a Cadillac?

JERRY: I bought you a Cadillac.



JERRY: Here you go.

HELEN: Are you out of your mind?

JERRY: What?

MORTY: You don't want it? Are you kidding?

HELEN: He's not buying us a Cadillac.

MORTY: What are you, nuts?

HELEN: It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.



MORTY: Can you believe this?!

HELEN: I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.

JERRY: How do you know?

HELEN: Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.

JERRY: Why can't I buy my father a car?

HELEN: Your father doesn't need a car.

MORTY: Yes I do!



HELEN: Oh Morty.

MORTY: We're keeping it.

HELEN: Over my dead body.



JERRY: Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.






KRAMER: Giddy up.

NICK: Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.



NICK: Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one.



NICK: I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning waiting for you to show up?!



NICK: You're not gonna get away with this!






MORTY: Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.

JERRY: That's what I was thinking.



JACK: Hello, Jerry.

JERRY: Hi, Jack.



MORTY: So, how do you like this?

JACK: Who's car?

MORTY: It's mine.

JACK: Yours?

MORTY: That's right. My son bought it for me.

JACK: He what?

MORTY: My son bought me the car. It's a present.

JACK: You bought it?

JERRY: That's right. I bought it.

MORTY: You ever see one so nice?

JACK: Some car.

MORTY: You wanna take a ride?

JACK: No thank you.

MORTY: Come on, take a ride.

JACK: I don't wanna take a ride.

MORTY: Why not?

JACK: I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!

JERRY: He doesn't wanna take a ride.

MORTY: Uh huh.

JACK: What do you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.

MORTY: Thousands?!

JACK: What? Do you think you're such a big shot now because you got a Cadillac?

MORTY: Ah!

JACK: Ah!



MORTY: Could you believe that guy?

JERRY: Ah!






GEORGE: Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.



GEORGE: You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say.  Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie on the uh, on the tape the other day and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. So, what do you, what do you think?



GEORGE: Move a pinkie if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?






KRAMER: Hello.

NICK: Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.



KRAMER: Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.

NICK: Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighborhood.



KRAMER: Oh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call waiting.

NICK: We can fix that. We can fix that.

KRAMER: Oh, can you? That's funny, because as it happens, I don't have call waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.

NICK: Oh, right. I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.

KRAMER: Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.








KRAMER: Hey, McNab!



KRAMER: Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?








MORTY: Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.

HERB: Come on Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?

MORTY: Well I, as your president have to find the best price and right now, I for one, do not think its cost feasible.

JACK: I'll bet you don't.

MORTY: What was that?

JACK: Come on Morty, the jig is up!

MORTY: What're you talking about?

JACK: I'm sorry. I'm sitting here the whole meeting holding my tongue. I've known you a long time Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.

HERB: What's going on, Jack?

JACK: I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.

MORTY: Stealing?!

RALPH: What proof do you have?

JACK: Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?

MORTY: My son bought me that car!

JACK: Your son?

MORTY: Yeah.

JACK: Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act last year at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!

HERB: Jack's right! He stinks!

RALPH: It's his material.

MORTY: I tell you, he bought it for me!

HERB: I move for a full investigation!

RALPH: I second.








MARISATOMEI: ...go introduce myself.



SUSAN: Hey! What're you watching? Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie and you've seen that one too. What, do you have a thing for her?



GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?

SUSAN: What are you talking about?







MARISATOMEI: Have I told you how much I love you today?

GEORGE: Not in the last fifteen minutes.

MARISATOMEI: Well, I do love you very much.

GEORGE: And I love you, Marisa.

MARISATOMEI: Well then come on, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere.












HELEN: Impeachment?

MORTY: That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?

HELEN: Can they do that?

MORTY: If they get the votes.

HELEN: I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.

JERRY: Didn't you tell them I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.

MORTY: It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.

JERRY: You know, you could put a fence around these condos and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!

MORTY: No one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.



EVELYN: Hello?

JERRY: Oh, hi Evelyn.



EVELYN: Hello, Jerry. I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.

HELEN: What did he say?

EVELYN: He's voting to impeach.



EVELYN: Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.

MORTY: I did so thank him!

HELEN: No, he never heard you. I told you he didn't hear you.

MORTY: Ah, he's deaf anyway.

EVELYN: Now, my sources tell me there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.

MORTY: Who's that?

EVELYN: Mrs. Choate.

JERRY: Who's she?

MORTY: Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.

HELEN: Maybe we should have her over for coffee and explain our side of it?

MORTY: That's a good idea.

EVELYN: Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.

HELEN: The Lichtenberg's?

EVELYN: Yes, they're having a party.

HELEN: We weren't invited.

EVELYN: Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.
