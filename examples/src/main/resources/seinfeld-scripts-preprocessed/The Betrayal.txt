



GEORGE: So Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!

ELAINE: George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.

GEORGE: Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.

GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!



JERRY: I said I was sorry.

GEORGE: You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY: Would you please stop saying that?!

KRAMER: What is up with you two?

GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.

KRAMER: So how was the big trip?

JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!



KRAMER: Well, what happened to your nose?

ELAINE: I don't want to talk about ow it!

KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?

ELAINE: She... was.

JERRY: Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.

KRAMER: Oh, that sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it.



GEORGE: You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.

JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!








SUEELLEN: That's it! The wedding's off.

PINTER: What? But, Sue Ellen...

SUEELLEN: Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with my Pinter?!

ELAINE: No no no! It was years ago before you met him. And, and I, I got to tell you it was very mechanical.

SUEELLEN: I have never been so humiliated!

ELAINE: Idiots! This is all your fault!

GEORGE: Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!

JERRY: George, I'm sorry.

GEORGE: Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!

JERRY: I don't know what that means.

GEORGE: Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?

NINA: Alright. Neither.

GEORGE: What?! Well, what are you doing here?

NINA: A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five six.

GEORGE: Five eight! Five seven!

ELAINE: See? See the way they are?! We're, we're still best friends, right?

SUEELLEN: No. And take that stupid thing out of your nose!



JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!

GEORGE: What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.








ELAINE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: What happened last night?

JERRY: Oh, you were pretty loaded.

ELAINE: I know. I woke up with this.



JERRY: Oh. Hello, tetanus.



NINA: George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.

GEORGE: No no no no, I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here. I'll sweat it out.

ELAINE: Hey.



ELAINE: Are those Timberlands painted black?

GEORGE: Is your nose pierced?

ELAINE: I should...



GEORGE: Yeah.



GEORGE: Sit down there.



GEORGE: Hello, Jerry. I believe you know Nina.

JERRY: George, we need to talk.

GEORGE: I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!

JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.

GEORGE: That's all?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!

JERRY: I'm really sorry.

GEORGE: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY: Where'd you get that one?

GEORGE: It's an expression.



ELAINE: Hey! Shh!



GEORGE: Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!

JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.

GEORGE: Funny guy!



ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!

GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

ELAINE: I'm not gonna sleep with you.

GEORGE: Reparations!

ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him, he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.

GEORGE: You slept with the groom?!










KRAMER: Oh, thank you, FDR! Alright, now we�re even.

FDR: I stuck a rock in there too.

KRAMER: Alright.










KRAMER: Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish, I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one hundred percent anti drop dead protection forever.

FDR: Alright.



KRAMER: Oh, man! Alright, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.



KRAMER: What, you want my kidney?



KRAMER: Mama.








ELAINE: George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.

JERRY: How did he find out?

ELAINE: He schnapped me.

JERRY: You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret!



JERRY: Is there anything else?

ELAINE: I can't tell you.

JERRY: Here, drink this.



ELAINE: Okay.



ELAINE: I slept with the groom.

JERRY: Pinter?

ELAINE: He used to be called Peter.

JERRY: So? Who cares about that?

ELAINE: Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.



JERRY: Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on. Up.



ELAINE: Do you know what Jerry is in Indian?



JERRY: No, what?

ELAINE: Jugdish.

JERRY: Yes, Jugdish.

ELAINE: Hey, what if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky. Oh!



JERRY: Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.



ELAINE: Goodnight, Jugdish.










JERRY: Bless you.

ELAINE: Thank you. Ah, hmm mmm.















KRAMER: Ah, hello FDR. Yeah, I�ll have a hot one.


KRAMER: Everything on it.

FDR: These things will kill you, but so what.



FDR: You�re already gonna drop dead



KRAMER: Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night and I wished against your wish.

FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double wished you to drop dead.



FDR: Here's your change.



KRAMER: Alright, I'm triple wishing! Yep!



FDR: Then I'm quadruple wishing!

KRAMER: Alright. How do you like this?



KRAMER: Yeah!



FDR: I like it a lot.



FDR: Ow!





KRAMER: Ah!





FDR: Oh!












ELAINE: Oh God, it's so hot! What is that smell?

JERRY: I think it's the stench of death.

NINA: George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding are you?

GEORGE: No. I'm gonna wear black shoes.



ELAINE: Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!

JERRY: This is gonna be great!

SUEELLEN: Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!

ELAINE: You are?

SUEELLEN: Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents and they're Indian.

ELAINE: Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall, we hate each other!

SUEELLEN: Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but I want you to be my maid of honor and my best friend.

ELAINE: Huh. Alright, I guess.

SUEELLEN: Uh, this is my fiancee, Pinter. Say hello.

PINTER: Hello.

ELAINE: Peter?

SUEELLEN: Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?

GEORGE: Oh, no no, we're good. Let's get going. Alright.



GEORGE: Watch it, funny man.



JERRY: Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?

ELAINE: No. What? Like what? What? Strange. No. I...

JERRY: Uh huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.



ELAINE: Oh.








KRAMER: Come on, Come on. Yes!



KRAMER: There's one! I wish I don't drop dead!!



KRAMER: You shut up!










GEORGE: Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?

JERRY: Coach to India. The only way to go.

GEORGE: Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!

JERRY: You alright?

GEORGE: Of course I'm alright. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend with whom there are no secrets.



GEORGE: Like this. Since the fourth grade.

JERRY: Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?

GEORGE: Funny guy! Right here!



NINA: By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did you?

ELAINE: Oh please, it�s in the vault.



GEORGE: Ho ha ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!






ELAINE: Hey, what time is it?



JERRY: You just asked me two minutes ago.






ELAINE: Hey, what time is it?

JERRY: Ah, I�m not wearing a watch.

ELAINE: Oh. Is this tooth chipped?



JERRY: Yeah. How�d you do that?

ELAINE: I have no idea.








ELAINE: Watch this.



ELAINE: Oh God.

GEORGE: So, Jerry and Nina, huh?

ELAINE: Oh, Mmm mmm.



ELAINE: I'm not gonna tell you anymore things.

GEORGE: You already told me everything.

ELAINE: Okey dokey.






KRAMER: I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!



NEWMAN: Did I?

MODEL: Newman, I'm bored.

NEWMAN: Aw.

KRAMER: Does your girlfriend have to be here?

NEWMAN: Does yours?



JERRY: I'm just hanging out in this hell hole because of George.

KRAMER: Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?

MODEL: Why don't you just make another wish?

KRAMER: And how am I gonna do that, Toots?

MODEL: What about a shooting star?

KRAMER: That's perfect.

NEWMAN: Beauty and brains.



JERRY: Oh come on. You know he's a postman, don't you?

NEWMAN: Huh.








ELAINE: Here�s your plane ticket.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. I�ll show her.

JERRY: By flying half way around the world?

ELAINE: Spite never sleeps.

JERRY: Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo.



GEORGE: Hey.



ELAINE: Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.

GEORGE: For how long?

ELAINE: Three days.

GEORGE: Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the best time with that Nina last night. I, I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend.



GEORGE: A great, great friend.



JERRY: Hey, hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!

KRAMER: Nah.

ELAINE: You want to go to India?

KRAMER: I can't. I'm gonna drop dead.



GEORGE: Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.



JERRY: Hey Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.

KRAMER: I'm going to Newman's!

JERRY: Great, I love Newman!



GEORGE: Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?

ELAINE: Nina? Nina? No... Not weird. No. Nina.

GEORGE: Why do you keep saying Nina?

ELAINE: I don't know. Nina. Nina!



ELAINE: I'm gonna go grab a bite.

GEORGE: Uh, I'll, I'll meet you down there.



GEORGE: Cereal, cereal.



GEORGE: Peach schnapps.










KRAMER: Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.



NEWMAN: You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.

MODEL: I could listen to you talk about mail all day.

KRAMER: Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes. They're meaningless!



KRAMER: Wish?! Newman!



KRAMER: Lomez, I�m leaving.












POSTMAN: Make a wish, Newman! We've gotta get back to work in three hours!



KRAMER: Newman, wait!

NEWMAN: Kramer! I'm with people.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!

NEWMAN: I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten... lost in the mail.



KRAMER: Well Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.

NEWMAN: Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.

KRAMER: Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?

NEWMAN: Your next, fifty wishes.

KRAMER: Forty-eight.

NEWMAN: Forty-nine.

KRAMER: Done!

NEWMAN: Sucker.

KRAMER: Sucker.



NEWMAN: Alright alright, back savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet.










ELAINE: Well ah, this Mischke mish mash is just getting worse.

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: I talked with the groom's parents.

JERRY: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.

ELAINE: And it's so obvious that they don't want...

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: ...me to go.

JERRY: Sure.

ELAINE: So, the only reason...

JERRY: Uh huh.

ELAINE: ...she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.

JERRY: Uh huh.

NINA: Jerry?

JERRY: Uh, well, you know a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.



NINA: Oh. Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

NINA: Oh, I should... um...

JERRY: Sure.

NINA: Yeah.

ELAINE: Bye bye.

NINA: Bye.



ELAINE: Who else you got back there?

JERRY: Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.

ELAINE: You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?

JERRY: Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this. It'll crush him.

ELAINE: Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.

JERRY: No good. Too many people know the combination.

ELAINE: What combination?



ELAINE: Don't be ridiculous.



JERRY: Oh my God. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!

ELAINE: So what?

JERRY: And milk.






KRAMER: Oh, geez.

JERRY: Hello?








ELAINE: Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?

ZUBIN: Please, call us Usha and Zubin.

ELAINE: Oh. Well, Usha.

ZUBIN: I'm Zubin.

ELAINE: Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.

USHA: You're not going to the wedding are you?

ELAINE: Well...

USHA: Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

ZUBIN: You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!

USHA: Here's the registry. Send her a gift and be glad you did not have to go.

ELAINE: Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.

ZUBIN: If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.

ELAINE: That's fantastic.

ZUBIN: And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.








NINA: Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.

JERRY: Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.

NINA: Really?

JERRY: Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.

NINA: I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.

JERRY: I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around.

NINA: Huh, yeah.

JERRY: Probably the reason.










FDR: Are, are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now... drop dead!



KRAMER: I knew it. Stupid Jerry.






JERRY: Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.

KRAMER: But you haven't seen...

JERRY: Just go back and ask him again.



KRAMER: Yeah.








FDR: That's right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead.

KRAMER: Well, why?

FDR: I have my reasons.

KRAMER: Whoa, wait wait wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.

FDR: That's just a silly superstition.








KRAMER: Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

GEORGE: FDR?

KRAMER: Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. I go to his birthday part and just before he blew out his candles he gives me this look.

GEORGE: Stink eye?

JERRY: Crook eye?

KRAMER: Evil eye.

JERRY: Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.

GEORGE: Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinking, "These are my friends?!"

JERRY: Everyday is my birthday.

KRAMER: Yeah, well I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.



ELAINE: Hi.



ELAINE: You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.

JERRY: Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.

ELAINE: Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this today.



JERRY: So you think it's a nonvite?

ELAINE: It's an unvitation!



ELAINE: Hey, are you getting taller?

GEORGE: Timberlands.



ELAINE: Ah. Hey, look at this. "Pinter Ranawat". I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat.

JERRY: Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.

GEORGE: Jerry, would you make the call already?

ELAINE: What call?

JERRY: He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.

ELAINE: Oh, the great conversation girl. The one you think can replace me?



JERRY: I was kidding when I said that!

GEORGE: Told me the same thing.

JERRY: Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.

GEORGE: You, you sure you never slept with her?



GEORGE: Perfect.

JERRY: Hey, how about my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?



GEORGE: Oh, something's not sitting right.








GEORGE: I'll have the Clams Casino.

JERRY: Get out of here.

GEORGE: "Chef recommends".

JERRY: Hmm.

GEORGE: I think she likes me.

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?

JERRY: Are you?

GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?

JERRY: We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.

GEORGE: How engrossing?

JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.

GEORGE: Wow! Heh. You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do you?





JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses. I need an awkward pause.

GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I, I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!

JERRY: So, you're gonna wear them no matter what the situation?

GEORGE: In every situation. No matter how silly I look.



GEORGE: Hmm, tastes a little funky.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it's fine.










KRAMER: Yeah!
















GEORGE: Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.

JERRY: Almost. Hey, new Timberlands?

GEORGE: Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: Five eight. Five seven.



NINA: Jerry?

JERRY: Nina?

NINA: Hi.

JERRY: It's been years!

NINA: Yeah!

JERRY: George, this is Nina.

GEORGE: Nice to meet you.

NINA: Nice to meet you, too.










ELAINE: India? Yeah, right. I'm going to India.








NINA: And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!

JERRY: What are you, a scientist?!

NINA: Ah, I gotta go.

JERRY: Ah.

NINA: It's great talking.

JERRY: Great talking to you.



JERRY: What the hell is e-mail?



GEORGE: How was the date?

JERRY: Pretty good. I think she might be the one.

SUSAN: No.

GEORGE: Whoa. Oh, French fries.

SUSAN: Ah, George.

GEORGE: Baked, uh, potato.

SUSAN: Uh huh.

GEORGE: Sorry.

SUSAN: Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.



KRAMER: Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packing tight!



JERRY: What are you bringing snowballs in here for?

KRAMER: Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard and when you throw it, Pop! Oh look.



KRAMER: there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great!





JERRY: Hi, Elaine.

GEORGE: Hey!

ELAINE: Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?








KRAMER: Oh hey, how you doing?

JERRY: Oh, hi. I, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm moving in. I saw your name on the buzzer. You must be Kessler.

KRAMER: Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.

JERRY: Oh.

KRAMER: Uh, you need any help or...

JERRY: No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?

KRAMER: Ah, no no no. I, I couldn't impose.

JERRY: Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours.



KRAMER: Oh.



KRAMER: Really?
