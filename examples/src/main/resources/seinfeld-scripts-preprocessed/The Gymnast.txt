

JERRY: I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"




JERRY: I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.

GEORGE: I think she finds my stupidity charming.

JERRY: As we all do.

GEORGE: Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.

JERRY: Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?

GEORGE: Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.

JERRY: You're good with the mothers.

GEORGE: You know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.

JERRY: Maybe you should date the mothers.

GEORGE: Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something going.

JERRY: Oh, you got something going.

GEORGE: Yeah.



KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: Hey!



KRAMER: Hey, you got a hammer?

JERRY: What do you need a hammer for?

KRAMER: Well, I got this new poster. 3D art? Computers generate them.

JERRY: Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.

KRAMER: No no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?

JERRY: Nah, I don't think so.

KRAMER: George, you wanna go for a ride?

GEORGE: Nah.

KRAMER: Oh, come on!

JERRY: Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?

KRAMER: Alright, I've had it with you two.



JERRY: Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?

KRAMER: A gymnast!

JERRY: Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the eighty-four Olympics.

KRAMER: A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex will melt your face.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.



KRAMER: "Bailing"?

JERRY: Yeah, you know Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should pay that price.

JERRY: She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?

KRAMER: What?



GEORGE: A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.

JERRY: What is this?

GEORGE: What, I'm putting my shirt back on.

JERRY: "Back on"? What was it doing off?

GEORGE: I take it off when I go to the uh, you know, to the "office".

JERRY: What for?

GEORGE: Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.

JERRY: Unbuttoned, or all the way off?

GEORGE: All the way, baby!

JERRY: Of course.



KRAMER: Yeow! Whoa.

JERRY: What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.



JERRY: You always take the shirt off?

GEORGE: Always.

JERRY: Boy, I tell you, knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next and I'm real scared.

 


MRPITT: Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.

ELAINE: What meeting?

MRPITT: I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.

ELAINE: Oh!



MRPITT: Are you using a fountain pen?

ELAINE: Yes?

MRPITT: They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.

ELAINE: Alright! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.



KRAMER: Elaine?

ELAINE: Come in, come in!

KRAMER: Yeah.



KRAMER: Yeah, huh?

ELAINE: Ah, right there, yeah.



KRAMER: Yeah, that's...

ELAINE: Kramer, it's...



KRAMER: There she blows!



ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?

KRAMER: Oh, these are nice corners, huh?

MRPITT: Elaine, did I hear...



MRPITT: Oh, this is very odd.

KRAMER: Yeah, its 3D art. Computers generate them. Big computers.

MRPITT: Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?

KRAMER: Well, you blur your eyes like you're staring straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...



KRAMER: Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

MRPITT: I don't see it.

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...

MRPITT: I still don't see it.

ELAINE: Okay Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.

KRAMER: You ever dream in three D? It's like the boogeyman is coming right at you.

MRPITT: A spaceship, where?

KRAMER: Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused.



KRAMER: Ah! Oh, mama!

ELAINE: Kramer, what's wrong?

KRAMER: Mama!

ELAINE: Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?

KRAMER: I think I gotta go to the doctor! Oh, mama!



MRPITT: How long does it usually take?

 




MRSENRIGHT: Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.

LINDSAY: Mother.

GEORGE: Oh, no no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.

MRSENRIGHT: Oh? Are you and your family close?

GEORGE: Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.

LINDSAY: Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?

GEORGE: Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait!



GEORGE: Nana, nice to see you. Nana!



GEORGE: Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?

MRSENRIGHT: Can I offer you anything to eat?

GEORGE: Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?

MRSENRIGHT: Oh no George, you don't have to.

GEORGE: No, I know I don't have to, I want to.

MRSENRIGHT: George, you are such a gentleman.

GEORGE: I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. Here we go, alright.

 




MRSENRIGHT: Oh.





GEORGE: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
 







ELAINE: Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!

MRPITT: Where is it?



ELAINE: Right here.

MRPITT: I'm looking there!

ELAINE: No no, unfocus.

MRPITT: I am unfocused!



ELAINE: Hello? Oh yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.

MRPITT: Meeting?

ELAINE: Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?

MRPITT: Why don't you go for me?

ELAINE: How can I go?

MRPITT: Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.

MRPITT: Oh, damn this thing!

 


JERRY: So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.

KATYA: Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.

JERRY: He uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"

KATYA: And you could not refuse.

JERRY: No, you'd have to be crazy.

KATYA: He was a very bad dictator.

JERRY: Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
 



JERRY: So let me get this straight. You find yourself in the kitchen. You see an eclair in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."

GEORGE: No no no no no. It was not trash!

JERRY: Was it in the trash?

GEORGE: Yes.

JERRY: Then it was trash.

GEORGE: It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.

JERRY: But it was in the cylinder!

GEORGE: Above the rim.

JERRY: Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.

GEORGE: It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.

JERRY: Was it eaten?

GEORGE: One little bite.

JERRY: Well, that's garbage.

GEORGE: But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!

JERRY: Well, you my friend have crossed the line that divides man and bum. You are now a bum.



JERRY: Hey!

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: I got a stone.

JERRY: What stone?

KRAMER: A kidney stone.

JERRY: What is that, anyway?

KRAMER: It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the urethra into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!

JERRY: Oh, that's gotta hurt.

 


ARONSON: Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.

ELAINE: Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock.



BECK: And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full scale production by the spring.

ELAINE: Alright. Hey you guys, what's the name of the new company gonna be?

BECK: Moland Spring.



ELAINE: "Moland"?

ARONSON: Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.

ELAINE: Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".

ARONSON: But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.

ELAINE: Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?

ARONSON: We've got to do something about that name.
 





GEORGE: No Lindsay, it was not in the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering, like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time.



GEORGE: It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Bye bye.



GEORGE: I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.

JERRY: Good for you.

GEORGE: Yes, good for me!

JERRY: You know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.

GEORGE: Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers. I will go to the florist!



KRAMER: Behold! The Games of the eighty-four Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance!



JERRY: Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.

KRAMER: Jerry, what is your problem?

JERRY: Kramer, you know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.

KRAMER: Alright Jerry, are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Tantric yoga?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!

JERRY: Boy, you can really talk some trash. I guess that's better than eating it.

KRAMER: Alright, alright, why don't we just watch the tape?



JERRY: Alright.

GEORGE: Did you pass your stone yet?

KRAMER: Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.



JERRY: Hey, that's her!

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.



KRAMER: Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse Hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing!


KRAMER: Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape?



KRAMER: I'll take that as a yes.
 



JERRY: Well, here we are.

KATYA: Yes. We are here.

JERRY: How did you stay on that beam like that? I mean, it's only this wide!

KATYA: I can balance myself in any position.



KATYA: It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.

JERRY: Oh boy.

 


JERRY: I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.

ELAINE: Well, what did you think she was gonna do?

JERRY: Well, you know. I mean... I don't know.

ELAINE: No, what?

JERRY: Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...

ELAINE: What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...

JERRY: You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...

ELAINE: Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?

JERRY: Well... frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kind of be like the apparatus.

KRAMER: You mean like the uneven parallel bars?

JERRY: See, again, I really don't feel that...

ELAINE: The balance beam?

JERRY: Could we stop?

ELAINE: Not the pommel horse?

JERRY: Alright. Let's just drop it.



JERRY: So let me ask you this. How long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.

ELAINE: I don't know, at least three weeks.

JERRY: Oh great.

ELAINE: Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.

JERRY: Between Poland and Morgan?

ELAINE: Yeah. Started a big name controversy.



JERRY: Kramer! The stone!



JERRY: What happened, did you pass the stone?

KRAMER: No, I tried to do a reverse Hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.

 




GEORGE: "...tootsie, good bye. Too too, tootsie..."



GEORGE: You call this coffee?



MANINCAR: Hey! What the hell was that?!

GEORGE: I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I, I...

MANINCAR: Clean that up!

GEORGE: Oh, sure. Of course.



GEORGE: Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. 

GEORGE: Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.



GEORGE: Look at this sparkle.



GEORGE: Mrs. Enright!



GEORGE: Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!

 




GEORGE: No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye bye.



JERRY: Strike two!

GEORGE: You think I'm going down?

JERRY: You're behind in the count.

GEORGE: I know.



KRAMER: Hey, what are you doing later?

JERRY: I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.

KRAMER: Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time. People are a little shy, a little reticent.

JERRY: If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.

KRAMER: Alright, where you going?

JERRY: We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.

KRAMER: Well Jerry, it's your obligation. Come on.

JERRY: Yeah, well, you know what? If I gotta go and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!

KRAMER: No no no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.

JERRY: Yeah, well you're going.

KRAMER: Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
 





MRPITT: I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.

ELAINE: Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?

MRPITT: I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!

ELAINE: Well, I'm so sorry! I...

MRPITT: Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting.



MRPITT: Elaine?

ELAINE: Oh, sorry.



ELAINE: Hello?



MRPITT: Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!

 




KATYA: So Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?

JERRY: Greatest Show on Earth!

KATYA: My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.

JERRY: Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.



KATYA: Ah, Misha!

MISHA: Katya!

KATYA: Misha, this is Jerry.

MISHA: Ah, yes. The "comedian", eh?





 




ELAINE: Oh yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um, hold on. Mr. Pitt!



MRPITT: I think I'm on to something!

ELAINE: Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!

MRPITT: You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want deep focus!

ELAINE: Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Let me just... 


ELAINE: Yeah, I've got it.



ELAINE: Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there.



ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop staring at that poster!

MRPITT: I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?



ELAINE: No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it!



ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!

MRPITT: Hmm, what's happened to me?



MRPITT: When's the meeting?

ELAINE: In about twenty minutes.

MRPITT: Oh!



MRPITT: Do I have time to change?

ELAINE: Um, no.

MRPITT: Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.

ELAINE: Uh, Mr. Pitt.

MRPITT: Yes?

ELAINE: Um, there's just a...





MRPITT: Is that ink?

ELAINE: No?



 


GEORGE: Well, here we are.

LINDSAY: Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.

GEORGE: Maybe I could just use the bathroom.

LINDSAY: Sure.

 




MISHA: It is time.

JERRY: Well, break a leg.



JERRY: Eh, show biz.





JERRY: Boy, those capes are really coming back.

 




PARTYGUEST: Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those three D art posters in there.



PARTYGUEST: It's mesmerizing.



 








 


JERRY: What is that sound?



KATYA: It is horrible!



 




GEORGE: Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!



 




MRPITT: I have been accused of wrong doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We will annex Poland by the spring, at any cost! And our stock will rise high!



 


KATYA: He'll be alright. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.

JERRY: Oh, why not?

KATYA: It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.

JERRY: Really?

KATYA: In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the "Comedian". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no comedian.
