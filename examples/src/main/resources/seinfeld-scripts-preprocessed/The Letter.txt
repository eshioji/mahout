

JERRY: Baseball season is starting, I'm very excited about that. Did you ever sneak down to better seats at the game and get caught by the usher? When you where a kid it didn't matter because you always get chased from every place anyway. When you're an adult it's really embarrassing getting caught. You have to pretend like there's some confusion. So you put on this whole act, you're looking at the ticket, "I don't understand how this could have happened? Let me see. Oh, I see the problem, these are very good seats, I have very bad seats. That's the misunderstanding."




NINA: Kramer, would you hold still? I can't do this if you keep moving.

KRAMER: You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? I'll do it!

NINA: No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do.

KRAMER: Well, why don't you take your clothes off?

NINA: I don't know. I don't think Jerry would like that.



KRAMER: Well, it'd be our little secret.






GEORGE: Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!

JERRY: I like the button fly.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. What are you doing today?

GEORGE: Nothing.

JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her loft and check out her paintings?

GEORGE: I don't get art.

JERRY: There's nothing to get.

GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.

JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.

GEORGE: What for?

JERRY: She sees something in him.

GEORGE: So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.




KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? Because they're brown. Or really, they're dark brown like rich Columbian coffee.

NINA: Tell me about Elaine.

KRAMER: She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

NINA: But they're still friends.

KRAMER: Oh yeah they're like this.



NINA: Don't you think that's strange?

KRAMER: Why, what's the difference?

NINA: Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?

KRAMER: Well you know... I uh... have many relationships.




GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.

JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.

GEORGE: Really? I thought you liked her.

JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her.



GEORGE: You know it's a miracle you're not married. Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything am I?



JERRY: Hi Nina.



JERRY: This is my friend George.

NINA: How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you.



JERRY: Hey, look at this guy!

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: I brought George up to see some of your paintings.

NINA: Oh are you interested?



GEORGE: Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.

KRAMER: George, you gonna buy a painting?

GEORGE: Yeah sure.

NINA: Are you an art lover?

GEORGE: I am an art adorer! I adore art.

NINA: Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like.



JERRY: May I?



NINA: Get out of here! Here, play with this.



JERRY: What's this?

NINA: My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.

JERRY: Oh, Saturday. I'm working, I'm going out of town.

NINA: Oh well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want them?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: They're right behind the dugout George, first row!

GEORGE: Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?

NINA: Oh my father's the Yankees accountant. It's the owner's box.

GEORGE: All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row behind the dugout!



NINA: You like that one?




GEORGE: Look at where we are! He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going!



GEORGE: We're not in the first row?

USHERATBALLGAME: No no, these are your seats.

GEORGE: She said first row! Right behind the dugout!

ELAINE: Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.

GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row. I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!

ELAINE: Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.

GEORGE: Oh there's better.



GEORGE: Right there, that's better.

KRAMER: Right.



KRAMER: Oh boy, okay, who wants a dog?



KRAMER: What a great day!

ELAINE: I could've been at my bosses son's bris right now.

GEORGE: You're supposed to do that?

ELAINE: Yeah. What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?

GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.

ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back, I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland.





KRAMER: You better catch it Johnny because this ain't Philadelphia!



LEONARDWEST: George?

GEORGE: Yeah?

LEONARDWEST: Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.

GEORGE: Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi!



KRAMER: Hey, two thirty ain't gonna cut it in this town babe!

GEORGE: And this is Kramer.

KRAMER: Oh hey.



LEONARDWEST: So how are the seats?

GEORGE: Okay.

ELAINE: Great, great.

KRAMER: Yeah.

LEONARDWEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.

GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. Not uh, too expensive is it?

LEONARDWEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.





LEONARDWEST: Well, enjoy the game. I think you better take off that Orioles cap.

ELAINE: Yeah. I better!

LEONARDWEST: No no no, seriously. You're in the owner's box and I don't think it's a good idea.

ELAINE: You're not serious.

LEONARDWEST: Yes, yes, yes I am!

ELAINE: Well, did he say that?

LEONARDWEST: No, no but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!

LEONARDWEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?

ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!

GEORGE: Just take the cap off.

ELAINE: George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!

LEONARDWEST: Look. Either you take the cap off or you'll have to leave.

ELAINE: Well, I don't care' I'm not taking it off.

GEORGE: Just take the cap off!

ELAINE: No!



KRAMER: Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!

GEORGE: Do you want us to go with you?



KRAMER: I'll go get your hat George.

ELAINE: Stay!

GEORGE: Okay, we'll go!






ELAINE: ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!

JERRY: Is he okay?

ELAINE: Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room and you know, the X-rays were all negative. It was quite a day!

JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard. Why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!

ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?



JERRY: How you feeling?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this page two, sports section. We're all in the picture.

ELAINE: What picture?

KRAMER: A picture.

ELAINE: Our picture is in there?

KRAMER: Uh huh.



ELAINE: I cannot believe this!

JERRY: There's George!

KRAMER: Yup, yup!

ELAINE: Oh my God! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my God I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!




ELAINE: Hi Mr. Lippman.

MRLIPPMAN: How's your father?

ELAINE: My, my father?

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah. You, you went to see him right?

ELAINE: Yeah.

MRLIPPMAN: Uh huh.

ELAINE: I went to visit him.

MRLIPPMAN: Uh huh. So, what was wrong with him?

ELAINE: Well, you name it, uh neuritis, uh neuralgia...

MRLIPPMAN: But, but he's feeling better now?

ELAINE: Um, yup. Yes, yes, its just... such a miracle. My visit must have buoyed...



ELAINE: ...his spirits.

MRLIPPMAN: Boo-eed.

ELAINE: What, what did I say?

MRLIPPMAN: You said "boyed."

ELAINE: I did?

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah.



MRLIPPMAN: Well I got a plane to catch.

ELAINE: Oh! Where are you going?

MRLIPPMAN: Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. Can I have my sports section?

ELAINE: Ah. Yeah.

MRLIPPMAN: I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.

ELAINE: There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...

MRLIPPMAN: Right, right.



MRLIPPMAN: What, what are you doing?

ELAINE: What? Oh!



ELAINE: Oh God!



ELAINE: That is the third time today I have done that!



ELAINE: Grabbing newspapers. I'm just tugging at them.



MRLIPPMAN: Gotta go.

ELAINE: Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip and uh... alrighty! I'll just hold down the, uh fort!




MRSARMSTRONG: I sense great vulnerability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.

MRARMSTRONG: I see a parasite.

MRSARMSTRONG: A sexually depraved miscreant who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.




NINA: She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.

JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. How can you defend that?




MRSARMSTRONG: He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!

MRARMSTRONG: He is a loathsome offensive brute, yet I can't look away.




JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.

NINA: Oh, well you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!

JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!

NINA: Hey, why don't you just go then! And oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me five hundred dollars!




MRSARMSTRONG: He transcends time and space.

MRARMSTRONG: He sickens me.

MRSARMSTRONG: I love it.

MRARMSTRONG: Me too.




GEORGE: Five hundred dollars?! What?

JERRY: That's what she told me!

GEORGE: I'm not paying five hundred dollars for this! It's a piece of junk!

JERRY: That's what it costs!

GEORGE: Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!

JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.

GEORGE: You weren't thinking.

JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.

GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?

JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you something!

GEORGE: I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her it'd be a different story.



KRAMER: This was in front of your door.

GEORGE: Hey Kramer.

KRAMER: Hi Mike.



JERRY: Wow, a letter from Nina!



KRAMER: Whoa man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!



JERRY: Oh my God!

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!

GEORGE: What's it say?

JERRY: Listen to this, "I don't know what you expect to find out there Jerry. You know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm willing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."

GEORGE: Wow!

KRAMER: She's deep.

JERRY: "...because that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, then fight for me, because..."



JERRY: "...because I'm sure as hell fighting for you!"

KRAMER: You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!

JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!



KRAMER: Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!

JERRY: Should I?

KRAMER: Yes! You're damn right you should! Fight for her Jerry. She's sure as hell fighting for you!

JERRY: Alright, alright! I'll call her.




JERRY: Shot!



JERRY: I told you!



JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.

NINA: What's the appeal of the posse?

JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends. Come on, it's a week long game of hide and seek on horseback.



NINA: Hello George.

GEORGE: Hey Nina! I owe you some money don't I?

NINA: Well I really love that piece.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.

NINA: No no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!

GEORGE: This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a door manned building.

NINA: Honestly George the money's not important.

GEORGE: Who said anything about money?



JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

JERRY: Come on up.

NINA: Elaine?

JERRY: Yeah.



NINA: This person does not believe in telephones does she?

JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in.



JERRY: He likes the pop-in too.

GEORGE: I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: How about Kramer.

JERRY: Huge pop-in guy!

NINA: Well, I was leaving anyway. So uh, we're on for tomorrow?

JERRY: Yeah.

NINA: Okay.

JERRY: Okay!

NINA: Bye.



ELAINE: Hello!



ELAINE: Chatty gal. Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!

JERRY: If he noticed he would have called you from Houston!

ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me.




ELAINE: Oh! Would you give me the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast!



JERRY: I'm a great clicker!



JERRY: Great instincts. How dare you impugn my clicking.

ELAINE: You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than five seconds. Give me that.



JERRY: Let go!

ELAINE: No come on! I want it Jerry!

JERRY: Let go Elaine!

ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!

JERRY: Oh, George can't click!



GEORGE: Give it! Give it!



GEORGE: Pinheads.



JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that.



ELAINE: It's Chapter Two, it's Neil Simon.

JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second!



JERRY: The letter, that's the letter!

ELAINE: What letter?

JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!



JERRY: "...because you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"

GEORGE: This is incredible!

JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter Two! She a thief, a bunko-artist!

GEORGE: Maybe I won't send her that check.

ELAINE: You know it's not really that terrible.

JERRY: What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!




MRLIPPMAN:  ...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? Aw, that's unbelievable. Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care.



MRLIPPMAN: That was Lenny West, my accountant who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too, it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives them to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! You're from Baltimore' right?

ELAINE: Um, oh it's Townsend, which is near Baltimore.

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah but you're an Oriole fan right?

ELAINE: Well, uh, fan. My father...

MRLIPPMAN: Anyway, she refused to take the cap off, caused a whole big scene!

ELAINE: Really?

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah.

ELAINE: So... impudent.

MRLIPPMAN: Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. I want you to come.

ELAINE: Ah. I've, I've got plans, though Mr. Lippman...

MRLIPPMAN: Well, break them. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.

ELAINE: Okay.

MRLIPPMAN: Good.



MRLIPPMAN: Oh and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.

ELAINE: That will be fun.




JERRY: How's it coming?

NINA: Good, good.

JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?

NINA: No, not really. You?

JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?

NINA: Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.

JERRY: I've seen most of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter Two. Have you ever seen that?

NINA: I don't know... maybe.

JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it.



JERRY: I couldn't help notice a stunning similarity...



MRARMSTRONG: Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."




GEORGE: Five thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for five thousand dollars?



JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!

GEORGE: So is it all over between you and Marsha Mason?

JERRY: Yeah.



JERRY: And by the way, can you get this thing out of my house?

GEORGE: Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.



GEORGE: Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.








KRAMER: ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. This steak is excellent by the way.

MRSARMSTRONG: More potatoes?

KRAMER: Yeah, sure. Please.

MRARMSTRONG: Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?

KRAMER: Yeah. And it was a big one.
