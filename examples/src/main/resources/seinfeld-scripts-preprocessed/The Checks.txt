



JERRY: Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.

ELAINE: Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.

JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?



ELAINE: What is this, a "bit"?

JERRY: No.

ELAINE: Because I'm not in the mood.

JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!

ELAINE: Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.

JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.

ELAINE: Alright, are you done with your little amusement?

JERRY: Then you admit it was amusing?

ELAINE: It was okay, but move the "medication for the well" to the front, and hit the word "good" harder.

JERRY: Great. Thanks.






ELAINE: So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?

BRETT: We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.



ELAINE: Oh, Farbman.

BRETT: You know Farbman?

ELAINE: Mmm, love Farbman.

BRETT: Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.

ELAINE: If you call that living.





ELAINE: Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?



ELAINE: Brett? Don't you think that would be great?



ELAINE: Brett?

BRETT: After the song, babe.

ELAINE: Huh?

BRETT: The song.








JERRY: So when do I meet this jerk?

ELAINE: He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.

JERRY: Who?

ELAINE: I donï¿½t know, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.

JERRY: What song?

ELAINE: Desperado.

JERRY: Desperado?

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.



JERRY: See that salesman twirling that umbrella?

ELAINE: Uh huh.

JERRY: I invented that.

ELAINE: That had to be invented?

JERRY: When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it to attract customers.



ELAINE: Oh ho, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?



JERRY: Elaine.

ELAINE: Excuse me. Hey, how you doing? Um, my uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.

JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.

CLICKY: Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.

ELAINE: Oh.

JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.

CLICKY: Yeah, that's where he come up with it.

JERRY: In his dreams.

ELAINE: Alright, can we go?



JERRY: By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.






JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

GEORGE: I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? You get them for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

JERRY: Those belong to people.



KRAMER: Hey. Well.



KRAMER: This was downstairs for you.

JERRY: Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign them.

GEORGE: What checks?

KRAMER: Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.

JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.

KRAMER: Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.



JERRY: They run it all the time and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.

GEORGE: Look at all of those! You're rich!

JERRY: Nah. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign them.



KRAMER: Hey Jerry, you need any new furniture?

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Yeah well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.



GEORGE: He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?

JERRY: Ah, who are any of her losers?

GEORGE: You're on that list.



GEORGE: Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.

KRAMER: Oh, no no no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

GEORGE: Yeah, you heard of them?

KRAMER: They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.

GEORGE: So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.

JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.






JERRY: Signed over a hundred checks this morning.

KRAMER: Hello, twelve dollars.



MROH: Excuse me. Would you take picture please?

KRAMER: Oh yeah, sure.



JERRY: I'm gonna ask this guy something.



JERRY: Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?



KRAMER: Hey, are you folks from Japan?

MRYAMAGUCHI: Hai.

MROH: Yes.



KRAMER: You recognize that mug?



KRAMER: That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.

MROH: Ah, Super Terrific Happy...



KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.



MROH: What is he doing?

KRAMER: Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.

MROH: He's funny.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.



KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.








CREWLEADER: We're pretty much finished.



CREWLEADER: There's just one more thing.

GEORGE: Here it comes.



CREWLEADER: You forgot to sign your check.



GEORGE: Sorry. You're sure uh, there isn't anything else?

CREWLEADER: No.



GEORGE: So, that's it?

CREWLEADER: Unless you need a receipt.

GEORGE: I wish that was all I needed. Life can be so confusing. I, I'm searching for answers, anywhere.

CREWLEADER: Good luck with that.








JERRY: Hey.

ELAINE: What's with the claw?

JERRY: Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.



BRETT: There's no sign of Kramer.

ELAINE: Oh, Brett. This is Jerry.

JERRY: Hi.



BRETT: That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kind of comedian.

JERRY: Ah, I'm one kind.



ELAINE: Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?

JERRY: The Fleckman.

BRETT: Farbman.

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: You gotta see them. Beautiful.

JERRY: Oh, I'm sure they are.

BRETT: I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.

JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you.

BRETT: Don't worry. It's no charge to you.



BRETT: Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.

JERRY: I don't write skits.

BRETT: Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalog.

ELAINE: Mmm. Brett, um, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.

BRETT: Oops.



BRETT: Well, I'm sure things will pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.



ELAINE: Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?

JERRY: Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?

BRETT: Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.

JERRY: You look like you could use a...

ELAINE: Jerry.






KRAMER: Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr. Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?



MROH: Ah, about uh, thirty thousand yen.

KRAMER: Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.



KRAMER: Giddy up. You're a cowboy now.








BRETT: I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?

ELAINE: Why? Why do you think he's upset?

BRETT: How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman like.

ELAINE: We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?

BRETT: I hope not.



ELAINE: Brett? Everything alright?



ELAINE: Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?

BRETT: Elaine, the song.

ELAINE: Oh. Oh oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...

BRETT: Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?

ELAINE: Sorry.








JERRY: No spiel?

GEORGE: Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!

JERRY: So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?

GEORGE: They could've at least tried!

JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?

GEORGE: Please.

JERRY: Too dumb?



JERRY: Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.

KRAMER: Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. They're known as gift givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.

JERRY: Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.

KRAMER: Well Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?



KRAMER: That's right.

GEORGE: How did you hook up with these guys?

KRAMER: Well, they recognized Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now they get you.

JERRY: What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?

KRAMER: Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.

GEORGE: Yeah, the pilot!

KRAMER: That's right, I think that had marvelous production values.

GEORGE: And you know, I do a lot of business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!

JERRY: Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.

GEORGE: It failed here! Because here every time you turn on a TV all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment whining about their dates!



KRAMER: George is right, Jerry. See, here you're just another apple, but in Japan you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.








JERRY: You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!

ELAINE: Well, why do I need your permission?

JERRY: Because he's my butler.



GEORGE: So? What do you think?

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?

GEORGE: Ah. You see, the man who was the butler uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry and because he didn't have any insurance the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: Is this customary in your legal system?

JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: Are you following any of this?

JAPANESEEXECUTIVETWO: I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr. Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.

GEORGE: Oh, I uh, I disagree. You've uh, you've been living in America too long. You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.



JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: Again with the oranges



JERRY: Sorry. My hand is numb.

GEORGE: Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour.

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: You must go now.








ELAINE: Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.

JERRY: What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?

ELAINE: He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's out riding fences.

JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share.

ELAINE: Yes. You're right. We need to find our song.

JERRY: Okay. So is there any song that you feel very strongly about?



ELAINE: I like Witchy Woman.

JERRY: Witchy Woman?

ELAINE: You know, Witchy Woman. Oh oh, witchy woman.

JERRY: Ah. Witchy Woman.



KRAMER: Hey, man.

ELAINE: Hey.



JERRY: Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?

KRAMER: Uh, well we uh, we had to leave early. There was a uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.

JERRY: Ah.

KRAMER: Uh listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?

JERRY: What for?



KRAMER: Yeah, well uh, my Japanese friends are gonna stay with me.

JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?



KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.

JERRY: Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?

KRAMER: Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.

ELAINE: Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

KRAMER: Evidently. Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.

ELAINE: In them?!

JERRY: You have them sleeping in drawers?!

KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.

JERRY: This has international incident written all over it.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah.






KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr. Tanaka.



MRTANAKA: Goodnight.



KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr. Oh.

MROH: Goodnight.



KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr. Yamaguchi.

MRYAMAGUCHI: Oyasuminasai.








JERRY: What is this?

KRAMER: Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.

JERRY: Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.

KRAMER: Sayonara.

JERRY: Konichi-wa.








BRETT: Elaine, I...

ELAINE: Shh shh! What do you think?



ELAINE: What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.

BRETT: Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.

ELAINE: Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? We can share it.

BRETT: No. It's mine.








KRAMER: Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.



KRAMER: Good morning, Mr. Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.

MROH: Ach, come back in half hour.








JERRY: Hey, I'll take one.

CLICKY: Well, look whose back!



CLICKY: Teddy! This is the guy says he invented the twirl.

TEDDY: Jerry Seinfeld!

JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. What've you got in a push-button mini.

TEDDY: Same thing we had when you bailed on us fifteen years ago.

JERRY: Bailed? Come on, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

TEDDY: Oh yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.



CLICKY: Umbrella, buddy?



CLICKY: Now we got that damn urban sombrero to contend with.

TEDDY: Easy, there. I hear you're taking credit for the twirl.

JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?

TEDDY: I care. Clicky cares.

JERRY: So, could I...



JERRY: Could I just buy an umbrella?

TEDDY: Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.

JERRY: What?!

TEDDY: Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.








KRAMER: Hey George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.

GEORGE: Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.

KRAMER: Ah listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind they're a little light on the yen.



GEORGE: Well I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.

KRAMER: That's perfect. Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?



MROH: But, we are also very hungry.

KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah.



KRAMER: Well, you guys just watch the tape and uh, I'll get you some food.



KRAMER: Hey, peanuts!



WILHELM: George. George.



WILHELM: Uh George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?

GEORGE: Are they here?

WILHELM: They're in my office right now.

GEORGE: They haven't said anything to you, have they?

WILHELM: About what?

GEORGE: What kind of a snobby, stuck-up cult is this?!






BRETT: Hey Jerry!



JERRY: Oh, hi Brett.

BRETT: Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?

JERRY: Ah, I didn't have enough money.

BRETT: I'm sure things will pick up for you.

JERRY: No, it's not that, it's the...



JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!



BRETT: Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the twelve cents?

JERRY: No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.

BRETT: Nothing's working for you, is it?

JERRY: Not at the moment, Brett.

BRETT: I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.



JERRY: Thanks for stopping!








ELAINE: Brett said you ran away from him as if he were the boogetyman.

JERRY: Boogeyman.

ELAINE: Boogey?

JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?

ELAINE: No. He blew out my Witchy Woman and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what do you think of Oy Como Va?

JERRY: Eh.

ELAINE: Well, I'm running out of guys here in this city, Jer!



JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!

JERRY: Really? They bought the butler character?

GEORGE: Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.

JERRY: NBC?

GEORGE: Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.



JERRY: Ah. But they told us we must go now.

GEORGE: But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.



JERRY: Hey George, do me a favor. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. Just take it!



GEORGE: Hey, by the way, what do you think of Miss Yoshimura?

JERRY: Who?

GEORGE: The network executive. You think she liked me?













KRAMER: Hey! Look who's here.



KRAMER: Come on, I want you to come in here.



MROH: Come on in, fat boy!



GEORGE: Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. Big day tomorrow!








JERRY: Last one.



JERRY: Ugh! Ah.






KRAMER: There you are.



GEORGE: Uh. Where's the boys?

KRAMER: Uh no, I let them sleep in.



KRAMER: I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.

GEORGE: But that meeting starts in ten minutes!

KRAMER: No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot tub.



GEORGE: I'm calling Jerry.






JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot tub! You gotta get them out of the drawers and get them down here or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!

JERRY: Uncle Leo?

GEORGE: Jerry!!



JERRY: Alright, alright. I'll wake them up.



JERRY: Hmm, testy.






JERRY: Hello?

MROH: Mr. Jerry! Open the drawer, please!



JERRY: It's stuck. Ow! The steam from the hot tub must have warped the wood.

MROH: Pull harder.

JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.

MROH: Very funny, but no joking, please.

JERRY: Don't worry, I'll get you out.






ELAINE: Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.

BRETT: Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's a start.

ELAINE: Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.



JERRY: Move to the back of the drawers!



ELAINE: Jerry?






ELAINE: Jerry.



BRETT: Not the Farbman!!








MROH: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.



GEORGE: So uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?

MROH: Could we have a couple of those oranges?



MROH: We are very hungry and have survived many hardships.



GEORGE: Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: Yes. Cleaned up the coffee stain left by Jerry Seinfeld.



GEORGE: Mr. Wilhelm? What, what're you doing here?

WILHELM: I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And one day, we will do the cleaning.



GEORGE: Him you brainwashed! What's he got that I don't have?!



GEORGE: Mr. Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr. Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!

WILHELM: Wilhelm? My name is Tanya.



JAPANESEEXECUTIVEONE: With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.








JERRY: Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with an axe.



JERRY: At least it was just the handle!

BRETT: It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...



BRETT: I can't remember his name!

JERRY: Fleckman?

ELAINE: Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down.



ELAINE: Desperado, mmm mmm mmm. You better...

JERRY: Let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...











EMERGENCYNURSE: His pulse is fine.

EMERGENCYDOCTOR: Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.



EMERGENCYNURSE: Doctor?



EMERGENCYNURSE: Doctor?



EMERGENCYNURSE: Doctor?



EMERGENCYNURSE: Doctor, I think we're losing him!
